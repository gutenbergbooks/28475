<h3>THE EYE: ITS PRIMARY IDEA.</h3>

  <p>I do not remember to have remarked that any writer notices how
  uniformly, in almost all languages, the same primary idea has been
  attached to the eye. This universal consent is the more remarkable,
  inasmuch as the connexion in question, though of course most appropriate
  and significant in itself, hardly seems to indicate the most prominent
  characteristic, or what we should deem to be <i>par excellence</i> the
  obvious qualities of the eye; in a word, we should scarcely expect a term
  derived from a physical attribute or property.</p>

  <p>The eye is suggestive of life, of divinity, of intellect, piercing
  acuteness (<i>acies</i>); and again, of truth, of joy, of love: but these
  seem to have been disregarded, as being mere indistinctive accidents, and
  the primary idea which, by the common consent of almost all nations, has
  been thought most properly to symbolise this organ is a
  spring&mdash;<i>fons</i>, <span title="pÃªgÃª" class="grk"
  >&pi;&eta;&gamma;&#x1F75;</span>.</p>

  <p>Thus, from <span lang="he" class="heb" title="`IYN" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E2;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>, <i>manare,
  scatere</i>, a word not in use, according to Fuerst, we have the Hebrew
  <span lang="he" class="heb" title="`AYIN" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E2;&#x5B7;&#x5D9;&#x5B4;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>, <i>fons
  aquarum et lacrimarum</i>, h.&nbsp;e. <i>oculus</i>. This word however, in its
  simple form, seems to have almost lost its primary signification, being
  used most generally in its secondary&mdash;<i>oculus</i>. (Old Testament
  Hebrew version, <i>passim</i>.) In the sense of <i>fons</i>, its

  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5B7;&#x5E2;&#x5B0;&#x5D9;&#x5B8;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>
  is usually substituted.</p>

  <p>Precisely the same connexion of ideas is to be found in the Syriac,
  the Ethiopic, and the Arabic.</p>

  <p>Again, in the Greek we find the rarely-used word <span title="opÃª" class="grk"
  >&#x1F40;&pi;&#x1F75;</span>, a fountain, or more properly the
  <i>eye</i>, whence it wells out,&mdash;the same form as <span title="opÃª" class="grk"
  >&#x1F40;&pi;&#x1F75;</span>, <i>oculus</i>; <span title="Ã´ps, opsis, optomai" class="grk"
  >&#x1F62;&psi;, &#x1F44;&psi;&iota;&sigmaf;,
  &#x1F44;&pi;&tau;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&iota;</span>. Thus, in St. James
  his Epistle, cap. iii. 11.: <span title="mÃªti hÃª pÃªgÃª ek tÃªs autÃªs opÃªs bruei to gluku kai to pikron" class="grk"
  >&mu;&#x1F75;&tau;&iota; &#x1F21; &pi;&eta;&gamma;&#x1F74;
  &#x1F10;&kappa; &tau;&#x1FC6;&sigmaf;
  &alpha;&#x1F50;&tau;&#x1FC6;&sigmaf; &#x1F40;&pi;&#x1FC6;&sigmaf;
  &beta;&rho;&#x1F7B;&epsilon;&iota; &tau;&#x1F78;
  &gamma;&lambda;&upsilon;&kappa;&#x1F7A; &kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76;
  &tau;&#x1F78; &pi;&iota;&kappa;&rho;&#x1F79;&nu;</span>.</p>

  <p>In the Welsh, likewise, a parallel case occurs: <i>Llygad</i>, an eye,
  signifies also the spring from which water flows, as in the same passage
  of St. James: <i>a ydyw ffynnon o'r un llygad</i> (from one spring or
  eye) <i>yn rhoi dwfr melus a chwerw?</i></p>

  <p>On arriving at the Teutonic or old German tongue, we find the same
  connexion still existing: <i>Avg</i>, <i>auga</i>,&mdash;<i>oculus</i>;
  whence <i>ougen ostendere</i>&mdash;Gothis <i>augo</i>; and <i>awe, auge,
  ave, <span class="correction" title="Original reads `campres', corrected by errata in Issue 194."
  >campus</span> ad <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>amnem</i>. (Vid. Schilteri, <i>Thes.</i>,
  vol. iii. <i>ad voc.</i>) And here we cannot help noticing the similarity
  between these words and the Hebrew <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="Y'OR" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D9;&#x5B0;&#x5D0;&#x5B9;&#x5E8;</bdo></span>, which (as
  well as the Coptic <span class="correction" title="Original reads `iars', corrected by errata in Issue 194."
  ><i>iaro</i></span>) means primarily a river or stream from a spring;
  but, according to Professor Lee, is allied to <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="'WOR" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D5;&#x5B9;&#x5E8;</bdo></span>,
  light, the enlightenment of the mind, the opening of the eyes; and he
  adds, "the application of the term to water, as <i>running,
  translucid</i>, &amp;c., is easy." Here, then, is a similar connexion of
  ideas with a change in the metaphor.</p>

  <p>In the dialects which descended from the Teutonic in the Saxon branch,
  the connexion between these two distinct objects is also singularly
  preserved. It is to be found in the Low German, the Friesic, and the
  Anglo-Saxon. In the latter we have <i>eÃ¡</i>, <i>eah</i>, <i>eagor</i>, a
  welling, flowing stream; <i>eah</i>, <i>Ã¦gh</i>, <i>eage</i>, an eye,
  which might be abundantly illustrated.</p>

  <p>We could hardly fail to find in Shakspeare some allusion to these
  connected images in the old tongue; no speck of beauty could exist and
  escape his ken. Thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"In that respect, too, like a loving child,</p>
      <p>Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,</p>
      <p>Because kind Nature doth require it so."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Tit. And.</i>, Act V. Sc. 3.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;</p>
      <p>Your tributary drops belong to woe,</p>
      <p>Which you, mistaking, offer up for joy."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Rom. and Jul.</i>, Act III. Sc. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Many of the phrases of the ancient tongues, in which the eye bears a
  part, have been handed down to us, and are still preserved in our own. My
  space, however, forbids me to do more than allude to them; but there is
  one very forcible expression in the Hebrew <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="`AYIN B`AYIN" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E2;&#x5B7;&#x5D9;&#x5B4;&#x5DF;
  &#x5D1;&#x5BC;&#x5B0;&#x5E2;&#x5B7;&#x5D9;&#x5B4;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>,
  literally, eye in eye, which we render much less forcibly&mdash;face to
  face. The Welsh have preserved it exactly in their <i>llygad yn
  llygad</i>. Indeed, this is not the only instance in which they are proud
  of having handed down the Hebrew idiom in all its purity. Shakspeare
  twice uses the old phrase:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Since then my office hath so far prevailed,</p>
      <p>That face to face, and royal eye to eye,</p>
      <p>You have congreeted."&mdash;<i>Hen. V.</i>, Act V. Sc. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And in <i>Tro. and Cres.</i>, Act III. Sc. 3; but it appears now to be
  obsolete.</p>

  <p>Before concluding, I cannot help noticing, in connexion with this
  subject, the Old English term "the apple of the eye." I am unable to
  trace it beyond the Anglo-Saxon. The Teutonic <i>sehandes ougen</i>,
  <i>pupilla oculi</i>, is totally distinct; <i>seha</i> being merely
  <i>medius punctus oculi</i>, whence <i>sehan</i>, <i>videre</i>. In the
  Semitic languages, as well as in the Greek and Latin, the origin of the
  term is the same, and gives no clue to the meaning of the Saxon term.
  Thus, in the Hebrew <span lang="he" class="heb" title="'IYSHWON" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5E9;&#x5C1;&#x5D5;&#x5B9;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>,
  dim. of <span lang="he" class="heb" title="'IYSH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5E9;&#x5C1;</bdo></span>,
  <i>homunculus</i>, the small image of a person seen in the eye. In Arabic
  it is the <i>man</i> or <i>daughter of the eye</i>. In Greek we have
  <span title="korÃª, korasion, korasidon" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F79;&rho;&eta;,
  &kappa;&omicron;&rho;&#x1F71;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&nu;,
  &kappa;&omicron;&rho;&alpha;&sigma;&#x1F77;&delta;&omicron;&nu;</span>;
  and in Latin, <i>pupa, pupula, pupilla</i>.</p>

  <p>Has any light been thrown on the Anglo-Saxon term? Can it be that
  <i>iris</i>, not the pupil, is taken to represent an apple? The pupil
  itself would then be the eye of the apple of the eye.</p>

<h3>GOSSIPING HISTORY&mdash;DE QUINCEY'S ACCOUNT OF HATFIELD.</h3>

  <p>In proof of the severity with which the laws against forgery were
  enforced, I have been referred to the case of Hatfield, hanged in 1803
  for forging franks. It is given very fully in Mr. De Quincey's "Literary
  Recollections of Coleridge" in the first volume of the Boston edition of
  his <i>Works</i>.</p>

  <p>The story has some romance in it, and excited great interest fifty
  years ago. Hatfield had lived by swindling; and, though he underwent an
  imprisonment for debt, had, upon the whole, a long career of success. The
  last scene of his depredations was the Lakes, where he married a barmaid,
  who was called "The Beauty of Buttermere." Shortly after the marriage he
  was arrested, tried, and executed. Mr. De Quincey afterwards lived in the
  neighbourhood, dined at the public-house kept by Mary's father, and was
  waited upon by her. He had the fullest opportunities of getting correct
  information: and his version of the story is so truthlike, that I should
  have accepted it without hesitation but for the hanging for forging a
  frank. As that offence never was capital, and was made a felony
  punishable with transportation for seven years by 42 Geo. III. c.&nbsp;63., I
  was impelled to compare the statement founded on gossip with more formal
  accounts; and I send the result in illustration of the small reliance
  which is to be placed on tradition in such matters. The arrival of
  Hatfield in a carriage is graphically described. He called himself the
  Hon. Augustus Hope, brother of the Earl of Hopetoun. Some doubts were
  felt at first, but&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To remove suspicion, he not only received letters addressed to him
  under this assumed name, but he continually franked letters by that name.
  Now, <i>that being a capital offence</i>, being not only a forgery, but
  (as a forgery on the Post-office) sure to be prosecuted, nobody presumed
  to question his pretensions any longer; and henceforward he went to all
  places with the consideration due to an earl's brother."&mdash;P.
  196.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The marriage with Mary Robinson, and the way in which they passed the
  honeymoon, are described:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"They continued to move backwards and forwards, until at length,
  <i>with the startling of a thunderclap to the</i> <!-- Page 27 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span><i>affrighted
  mountaineers</i>, the bubble burst; officers of justice appeared, <i>the
  stranger was easily intercepted from flight</i>, and, <i>upon a capital
  charge</i>, he was <i>borne away to Carlisle</i>. At the ensuing assizes
  he was <i>tried for forgery on the prosecution of the Post-office</i>,
  found guilty, left for execution, and executed accordingly."&mdash;P.
  199.</p>

  <p>"One common scaffold confounds the most flinty hearts and the
  tenderest. However, it was in some measure the heartless part of
  Hatfield's conduct which drew upon him his ruin; for <i>the Cumberland
  jury</i>, as I have been told, <i>declared their unwillingness to hang
  him for having forged a frank</i>; and both they, and <i>those who
  refused to aid his escape when first apprehended</i>, were reconciled to
  this harshness entirely by what they heard of his conduct <i>to their
  injured young fellow-countrywoman</i>."&mdash;P. 201.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Hatfield was not "easily intercepted from flight." Sir Frederick Vane
  granted a warrant to apprehend him on the charge of forcing franks.
  Hatfield ordered dinner at the Queen's Head, Keswick, to be ready at
  three; took a boat, and did not return. This was on October 6: he was
  married to Mary on the 2nd. In November he was apprehended near
  Brecknock, in Wales: so those who refused to aid his escape, if such
  there were, were not "reconciled to the hardship by what they heard of
  his conduct to their young fellow-countrywoman." The "startling of the
  thunderclap" was preceded by an ordinary proclamation, describing the
  offender, and offering a reward of 50<i>l.</i> for his apprehension. He
  was not "hurried away to Carlisle," but deliberately taken to London on
  December 12; examined at Bow Street, remanded three times, and finally
  committed; and sent to Carlisle, where he was tried on August 15,
  1803.</p>

  <p>Three indictments were preferred against him: the first for forging a
  bill of exchange for 20<i>l.</i>, drawn by Alexander Augustus Hope on
  John Crump, payable to George Wood; the second for a similar bill for
  30<i>l.</i>; and the third for counterfeiting Colonel Hope's handwriting
  to defraud the Post-office.</p>

  <p>The Cumberland jury did not "declare their unwillingness to hang him
  for forging a frank," that not being a capital offence. I infer, also,
  that it was one for which he was not tried. He was convicted on the first
  indictment; the court rose immediately after the jury had given their
  verdict; and the prisoner was called up for judgment at eight the next
  morning. Trying a man under sentence of death for a transportable felony,
  is contrary to all practice. Hatfield was executed at Carlisle on
  September 3, 1803.</p>

  <p>Mary's misfortunes induced the sympathising public to convert her into
  a minor heroine. She seems to have been a common-place person, with small
  claims to the title of "The Beauty of Buttermere." A cotemporary account
  says, "she is rather gap-toothed and somewhat pock-marked." And Mr. De
  Quincey, after noticing her good figure, says, "the expression of her
  countenance was often disagreeable."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A lady, not very scrupulous in her embellishment of facts, used to
  tell an anecdote of her which I hope was exaggerated. Some friend of
  hers, as she affirmed, in company with a large party, visited Buttermere
  a day or two after that on which Hatfield suffered; and she protested
  that Mary threw on the table, with an emphatic gesture, the Carlisle
  paper containing an elaborate account of the execution."&mdash;P.
  204.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Considering the treatment she had received, it is not unlikely that
  her love, if she ever had any for a fat man of forty-five, was turned
  into hatred; and it was not to be expected that her taste would keep down
  the manifestation of such feeling. When Hatfield was examined at Bow
  Street, Sir Richard Ford, the chief magistrate, ordered the clerk to read
  aloud a letter which he received from her. It was:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir,&mdash;The man whom I had the misfortune to marry, and who has
  ruined me and my aged and unhappy parents, always told me that he was the
  Hon. Colonel Hope, the next brother to the Earl of Hopetoun.</p>

<p class="cenhead">"Your grateful and unfortunate servant,<br />
"<span class="sc">Mary Robinson</span>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I do not blame Mr. De Quincey, having no doubt that he believed what
  he was told; but I have put together these facts and discrepancies, to
  show how careful we should be in accepting traditions, when a man of very
  high ability, with the best opportunities of getting at the truth, was so
  egregiously misled.</p>

  <p>My authorities are, <i>The Annual Register</i>, 1803, pp. 421. and
  428.; <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 1803, pp. 779. 876. and 983.;
  Kirby's <i>Wonderful Magazine</i>, vol.&nbsp;i. pp. 309. and 336. <i>The
  Newgate Calendar</i> gives a similar account but not having it at hand, I
  cannot vouch it.</p>

<h3>NOTES UPON THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE EARLY INHABITANTS OF HELLAS.</h3>

  <p>I. I have never seen it yet noticed, that the names <i>Pyrrha</i>,
  <i>Ãolus</i>, <i>Xuthus</i>, <i>Ion</i>, are all names of <i>colours</i>.
  Is there anything in this, or is it fortuitous?</p>

  <p>II. In accordance with the above, I think we may refer most of the
  names of the early inhabitants of Greece to words denoting <i>light</i>
  or <i>colour</i>, or the like.</p>

  <p>(1.) <i>Pelas-gi.</i> The first part of this word is, by Mr.
  Donaldson, connected with <span title="mel-as" class="grk"
  >&mu;&#x1F73;&lambda;-&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>, which is also, probably,
  the root of <i>Mol-ossi</i>.</p>

  <p>(2.) <i>Hellenes</i>, connected with <i>Helli</i>, <i>Selli</i>, <span
  title="selas, heulÃª, hÃªlios" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&#x1F73;&lambda;&alpha;&sigmaf;, &epsilon;&#x1F55;&lambda;&eta;,
  &#x1F25;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>. This derivation is made
  more probable <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>by the fact, that the neighbouring Pelasgic
  tribes have a similar meaning; <i>e.g.</i>,</p>

  <p><i>PerrhÃ¦bi</i>, alike to <i>Pyrrha</i> and <span title="pur" class="grk"
  >&pi;&#x1FE6;&rho;</span>; <i>Ãthices</i>, <span title="aithÃ´" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F34;&theta;&omega;</span>, <i>TymphÃ¦i</i>, <span
  title="tuphÃ´" class="grk">&tau;&#x1F7B;&phi;&omega;</span>;
  <i>HestiÃ¦i</i>, <span title="hestia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F11;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F77;&alpha;</span>. Add to this, that the name
  <i>Phthiotis</i> seems indubitably to derive its name from <i>Phthah</i>,
  the Egyptian <i>HephÃ¦stus</i>, and to be a translation of the word
  <i>Hellas</i>.</p>

  <p>N.B.&mdash;The existence of an Egyptian colony in that part is
  attested by the existence of a Phthiotic <i>ThebÃ¦</i>.</p>

  <p>(3.) On the other hand, the word <i>AchÃ¦us</i> seems to be connected
  with <span title="achos, achnumai" class="grk"
  >&#x1F04;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
  &#x1F00;&chi;&nu;&#x1F7B;&mu;&alpha;&iota;</span>, and <span
  title="achlus" class="grk">&#x1F04;&chi;&lambda;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>
  in the sense of gloom (of <span title="ouranion achos" class="grk"
  >&omicron;&#x1F50;&rho;&#x1F71;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu;
  &#x1F04;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>). So the Homeric <i>Cimmerians</i>
  are derived from <span lang="he" class="heb" title="KIMRIYRIY" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5BC;&#x5B4;&#x5DE;&#x5B0;&#x5E8;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5E8;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;</bdo></span>
  (Job), denoting <i>darkness</i>.</p>

  <p>(4.) Lastly, I submit with great diffidence the following examination
  of the words <i>Dorus</i> and the Ãolian <i>MinyÃ¦</i>, which I shall
  attempt to derive from words denoting <i>sun</i> and <i>moon</i>
  respectively.</p>

  <p>The word <i>Dorus</i> I assume to be connected with the first part of
  the names <i>Dry-opes</i> and <i>Dol-opes</i>. The metathesis in the
  first case seems sanctioned by the analogy of the Sanscrit <i>drÃ®</i> and
  Greek <span title="deirÃ´" class="grk"
  >&delta;&epsilon;&#x1F77;&rho;&omega;</span>, and the mutation of
  <i>l</i> and <i>r</i> in the second is too common in Greek and Latin to
  admit of any doubt, <i>e.g.</i> <span title="ar-galeos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&rho;-&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&#x1F73;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> and
  <span title="algaletos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&lambda;&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&#x1F73;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>;
  <i>Sol</i> and <i>Soracte</i>. With this premised, I think we may be
  justified in connecting the following <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `word'.">words</span> with one another.</p>

  <p><i>Dores</i>, <i>Dryopes</i> with <span title="Seirios" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&epsilon;&#x1F77;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> (of <span
  title="Sios" class="grk">&Sigma;&iota;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span> and <span
  title="Dios" class="grk">&Delta;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>) <span
  title="Theros" class="grk">&Theta;&#x1F73;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  the Scythian sun-god <span title="Oito-surus" class="grk"
  >&Omicron;&#x1F30;&tau;&#x1F79;-&sigma;&upsilon;&rho;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>,
  the Egyptian <i>O-siris</i>, and perhaps the Hebrew <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="DWOR" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D3;&#x5D5;&#x5B9;&#x5E8;</bdo></span> and Greek <span
  title="dÃªros" class="grk">&delta;&eta;&rho;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;</span> (the
  course of the sun being the emblem of eternity).&mdash;<i>Dol-opes</i>
  with <i>Sol</i>, <span title="heilÃª" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&#x1F35;&lambda;&eta;</span>, <i>Selli</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the neighbouring <i>MinyÃ¦</i> seem connected with
  <span title="minuthÃ´, minuntha" class="grk"
  >&mu;&iota;&nu;&#x1F7B;&theta;&omega;,
  &mu;&#x1F77;&nu;&upsilon;&nu;&theta;&alpha;</span>,
  <i>minus</i>,&mdash;all with the sense of <i>decreasing</i> or
  <i>waning</i>; hence referable, both in sense and (I fancy) in
  derivation, to Greek <span title="mÃªn" class="grk"
  >&mu;&#x1F74;&nu;</span>, and Latin <i>men-sis</i>.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE READINGS, NO. IX.</h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"It lies as sightly on the back of him</p>
      <p>As great Alcides' shoes upon an ass."&mdash;<i>King John</i>, Act II. Sc. 1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The ass was to <i>wear</i> the shoes, and not to bear them on his
  back, as Theobald supposed, and therefore would read <i>shows</i>. The
  'shoes of Hercules' were as commonly alluded to by our old poets, as the
  <i>ex pede Herculem</i> was a familiar allusion of the learned." (Mr.
  Knight in 1839.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Fourteen years' additional consideration has not altered Mr. Knight's
  view of this passage. In 1853 we find him putting forth a prospectus for
  a new edition of Shakspeare, to be called "The Stratford Edition,"
  various portions from which he sets before the public by way of sample.
  Here we have over again the same note as above, a little diversified, and
  placed parallel to Theobald's edition in this way:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"It lies as sightly on the back of him</p>
      <p>As great Alcides' <i>shows</i> upon an ass."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<table class="nob" summary="Parallel comments." title="Parallel comments." style="width:50%">
<tr><td valign="top" class="spacsingle">"The folio reads 'Great Alcides'
shoes.' Theobald says,
'But why <i>shoes</i>, in the name of
propriety? For let Hercules and
his <i>shoes</i> have been really as big
as they were ever supposed to
be, yet they (I mean the <i>shoes</i>)
would not have been an overload
for an ass.'"
</td><td valign="top" class="spacsingle">
"The 'shoes of Hercules'
were as commonly alluded to
in our old poets, as the <i>ex pede
Herculem</i> was a familiar allusion
of the learned. It was not
necessary that the ass should be
overloaded with the shoes&mdash;he
might be <i>shod</i> (shoed) with
them."
</td></tr></table>

  <p>Now who, in reading these parallel notes, but would suppose that it is
  Mr. Knight who restores <i>shoes</i> to the text, and that it is Mr.
  Knight who points out the common allusion by our old poets to the shoes
  of Hercules? Who would imagine that the substance of this correction of
  Theobald was written by Steevens a couple of generations back, and that,
  consequently, Theobald's proposed alteration had never been adopted?</p>

  <p>I should not think of pointing out this, but that Mr. Knight himself,
  in this same prospectus, has taken Mr. Collier to task for the very same
  thing; that is, for taking credit, in his <i>Notes and Emendations</i>,
  for all the folio MS. corrections, whether known or unknown, necessary or
  unnecessary.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the very words of Mr. Knight's complaint against Mr. Collier
  are curiously applicable to himself:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It requires the most fixed attention to the nice distinctions of such
  constantly-recurring 'notes and emendations,' to disembarrass the cursory
  reader from the notion that these are <i>bonÃ¢ fide</i> corrections of the
  common text....</p>

  <p>"Who cares to know what errors are corrected in" (the forthcoming
  Stratford edition), "that exist in no other, and which have never been
  introduced into the modern text?"&mdash;<i>Specimen</i>, &amp;c., p.
  xxiv.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The impression one would receive from Mr. Knight's note upon Theobald
  is, that Shakspeare had his notion of <i>the shoes</i> from "our old
  poets," while <i>the learned</i> had <i>theirs</i> from <i>ex pede
  Herculem</i>; but where the analogy lies, wherein the point, or what the
  application, is not explained. Steevens' original note was superior to
  this, in so much that he quoted the words of these old poets, thereby
  giving his readers an opportunity of considering the justness of the
  deduction. The only set-off to this omission by Mr. Knight is the
  introduction of "ex pede Herculem," the merit of which is doubtless his
  own.</p>

  <p>But it so happens that the size of the foot of Hercules has no more to
  do with the real point of the allusion than the length of Prester John's;
  therefore <i>ex pede Herculem</i> is a most unfortunate
  illustration,&mdash;particularly awkward in a specimen sample, the
  excellence of which may be questioned. <!-- Page 29 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>{29}</span></p>

  <p>It is singular enough, and it says a great deal for Theobald's common
  sense, that <i>he</i> saw what the true intention of the allusion must
  be, although he did not know how to reconcile it with the existing letter
  of the text. He wished to preserve <i>the spirit</i> by the sacrifice of
  <i>the letter</i>, while Mr. Knight preserves the letter but
  misinterprets the spirit.</p>

  <p>Theobald's word "shows," in the sense of externals, is very nearly
  what Shakspeare meant by <i>shoes</i>, except that <i>shoes</i> implies a
  great deal more than <i>shows</i>,&mdash;it implies the assumption of the
  character as well as the externals of Hercules.</p>

  <p>Out of five quotations from our old poets, given by Steevens in the
  first edition of his note, there is not one in which <i>the shoes</i> are
  not provided with <i>feet</i>. But Malone, to his immortal honour, was
  the first to furnish them with <i>hoofs</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Upon an ass; <i>i.e.</i> upon the hoofs of an ass."&mdash;<i>Malone.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But Shakspeare nowhere alludes to feet! His ass most probably <i>had
  feet</i>, and so had Juvenal's verse (when he talks of his "satyrÃ¢
  sumente cothurnum"); but neither Shakspeare nor Juvenal dreamed of any
  necessary connexion between the feet and the shoes.</p>

  <p>Therein lies the difference between Shakspeare and "our old poets;" a
  difference that ought to be sufficient, of itself, to put down the common
  cry,&mdash;that Shakspeare borrowed his allusions from them. If so, how
  is it that his expositors, with these old poets before their eyes all
  this time, together with their own scholarship to boot, have so widely
  mistaken the true point of his allusion? It is precisely because they
  <i>have</i> confined their researches to these old poets, and have
  <i>not</i> followed Shakspeare to the fountain head.</p>

  <p>There is a passage in Quintilian which, very probably, has been the
  common source of both Shakspeare's version, and that of the old poets;
  with this difference, that he understood the original and they did
  not.</p>

  <p>Quintilian is cautioning against the introduction of solemn bombast in
  trifling affairs:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To get up," says he, "this sort of pompous tragedy about mean
  matters, is as though you would dress up children with the <i>mask</i>
  and <i>buskins</i> of Hercules."</p>

  <p>["Nam in parvis quidem litibus has trag&oelig;dias movere tale est
  quale si <i>personam</i> Herculis et <i>cothurnos</i> aptare infantibus
  velis."]</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here the addition of the <i>mask</i> proves that the allusion is
  purely theatrical. The mask and buskins are put for the stage trappings,
  or <i>properties</i>, of the part of Hercules: of these, one of the items
  was the <i>lion's skin</i>; and hence the extreme aptitude of the
  allusion, as applied by the Bastard, in <i>King John</i>, to Austria, who
  was assuming the importance of C&oelig;ur de Lion!</p>

  <p>It is interesting to observe how nearly Theobald's plain, homely
  sense, led him to the necessity of the context. The real points of the
  allusion can scarcely be expressed in better words than his own:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Faulconbridge, in his resentment, would say this to Austria, 'That
  lion's skin which my great father, King Richard, once wore, looks as
  uncouthly on thy back, as that other noble hide, which was borne by
  Hercules, would look on the back of an ass!' A double allusion was
  intended: first, to the fable of the ass in the lion's skin; then Richard
  I. is finely set in competition with Alcides, as Austria is satirically
  coupled with the ass."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>One step farther, and Theobald would have discovered the true
  solution: he only required to know that <i>the shoes</i>, by a figure of
  rhetoric called synecdoche, may stand for the whole character and
  attributes of Hercules, to have saved himself the trouble of conjecturing
  an ingenious, though infinitely worse word, as a substitute.</p>

  <p>As for subsequent annotators, it must be from the mental preoccupation
  of this unlucky "ex pede Herculem," that <i>they</i> have so often put
  their foot in it. They have worked up Alcides' shoe into a sort of
  antithesis to Cinderella's; and, like Procrustes, they are resolved to
  stretch everything to fit.</p>

<h3>GÃTHE'S AUTHOR-REMUNERATION.</h3>

  <p>The Note in your valuable Journal (Vol. vii., p. 591.) requires, I
  think, so far as it relates to GÃ¶the, several corrections which I am in
  the position of making. The amount which that great man is said to have
  received for his "works (aggregate)" is "30,000 crowns." The person who
  <i>originally</i> printed this statement must have been completely
  ignorant of GÃ¶the's affairs, and even biography. GÃ¶the had (unlike Byron)
  several publishers in his younger years. Subsequently he became closer
  connected with M. <i>J.&nbsp;G. Cotta</i> of Stuttgardt, who, in succession,
  published almost all GÃ¶the's works. Amongst them were <i>several</i>
  editions of his complete works: for instance, that published conjointly
  at Vienna and Stuttgardt. Then came, in 1829, what was called the edition
  of the last hand (<i>Ausgabe letzter Hand</i>), as GÃ¶the was then more
  than eighty years of age. During all the time these two editions were
  published, other detached new works of GÃ¶the were also printed; as well
  as new editions of former books, &amp;c. Who can now say that it was
  20,000 crowns (<i>thalers?</i>) which the great poet received for each
  various performance?&mdash;<i>No one.</i> And this for many reasons.
  GÃ¶the always remained with M. Cotta on terms of polite acquaintanceship,
  no more: there was no "My dear Murray" in their strictly business-like
  connexion. GÃ¶the also never wrote on such things, even in his biography
  or diary. But some talk was going around in Germany, that for <i>one</i>
  of the editions of his <i>complete</i> works (there <!-- Page 30 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>appeared still many
  volumes of posthumous), he received the above sum. I can assert on good
  authority, that GÃ¶the, foreseeing his increasing popularity even long
  after his death, stipulated with M. Cotta to pay his <i>heirs</i> a
  certain sum for every new edition of either his complete or single works.
  One of the recipients of these yet <i>current accounts</i> is Baron
  Wolfgang von GÃ¶the, AttachÃ© of the Prussian Legation at Rome.</p>

  <p><i>The Colour of Ink in Writings.</i>&mdash;My attention was called to
  this subject some years ago by an attempt made in a judicial proceeding
  to prove that part of a paper produced was written at a different time
  than the rest, because part differed from the rest in the shade of the
  ink. The following conclusions have been the result of my observations
  upon the subject:</p>

  <p>1. That if the ink of part of a writing is of a different shade,
  though of the same colour, from that of the other parts, we cannot infer
  from that circumstance alone that the writing was done at different
  times. Ink taken from the top of an inkstand will be lighter than that
  from the bottom, where the dregs are; the deeper the pen is dipped into
  the ink, the darker the writing will be.</p>

  <p>2. Writing performed with a pen that has been used before, will be
  darker than that with a new pen; for the dry residuum of the old ink that
  is encrusted on the used pen will mix with the new ink, and make it
  darker. And for the same reason&mdash;</p>

  <p>3. Writing with a pen previously used will be darker at first than it
  is after the old deposit, having been mixed up with the new ink, is used
  up.</p>

  <p><i>Literary Parallels.</i>&mdash;Has it ever been noticed that the
  well-known epitaph, sometimes assigned to Robin of Doncaster, sometimes
  to Edward Courtenay, third Earl of Devon, and I believe to others
  besides: "What I gave, that I have," &amp;c., has been anticipated by, if
  not imitated from, Martial, book v. epigr. 42., of which the last two

  when opened in 1653, "of the purest gold, their wings being inlaid with a
  red stone, like a cornelian," I beg to mention that the small ornaments
  resembling bees found in the tomb of Childeric, were only what in French
  are called <i>fleurons</i> (supposed to have been attached to the harness
  of his war-horse). Handfuls of them were found when the tomb was opened
  at Tournay, and sent to Louis XIV. They were deposited on a green ground
  at Versailles.</p>

  <p>Napoleon wishing to have some regal emblem more ancient than the
  <i>fleur-de-lys</i>, adopted the <i>fleurons</i> as bees, and the green

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>WAS THOMAS LORD LYTTELTON THE AUTHOR OF JUNIUS'S LETTERS?</h3>

  <p>In the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for 1852 (vol. xc. No. 179.) appeared a
  clever and speciously written article on the long debated question of the
  identity of Junius, in which the writer labours at great length to prove
  that Thomas, second Lord Lyttelton, who died in 1779, was the real
  substance of the shadow of Junius, hitherto sought in vain. That this
  Lord Lyttelton was fully competent to the task, I do not doubt; and that
  there are many points in his character which may well be reconciled with
  the knowledge we possess of the imaginary Junius, I also admit&mdash;but
  this is all. The author of the review has wholly failed, in my opinion,
  to prove his case and the remark he makes on Mr. Britton's theory (as to
  Col. BarrÃ©) may equally well apply to his own, namely, that it affords "a
  [another] curious instance of the delusion to which ingenious men may
  resign themselves, when they have a favourite opinion to uphold!" The
  reviewer, indeed, admits that he has "traced the parallel from the
  scantiest materials;" and in another passage repeats, that but "few
  materials exist for a sketch of Thomas Lyttelton's life." Of these
  materials used by the reviewer, the principal portion has been derived
  from the two volumes of letters published in 1780 and 1782, attributed to
  Lord Lyttelton, but the authorship of which has since been claimed for
  William Coombe. The reviewer argues, that they are "substantially
  genuine;" but evidence, it is believed, exists to the contrary.<a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> According to
  Chalmers, these letters were "publicly disowned" by the executors of Lord
  Lyttelton; and this is confirmed by the notice in the <i>Gentleman's
  Magazine</i> for 1780, p. 138., shortly after the publication of the
  first volume. Putting aside, however, this moot-point (which, I trust,
  will be taken up by abler hands, as it bears greatly on the theory
  advanced by the author of the <i>Review</i>), I proceed to another and
  more conclusive line of argument. In the <i>Preliminary Essay</i>,
  prefixed to Woodfall's edition of Junius, 1812 (vol.&nbsp;i. p. *46.), the
  following statement is made in regard to that writer, the accuracy of
  which will scarcely be doubted:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is another point in the history of his life, during his
  appearance as a public writer, which must not be suffered to pass by
  without observation: and that is, <i>that during a great part of this
  time, from January 1769 to January 1772, he uniformly resided in London,
  or its immediate vicinity, and that he never quitted his stated
  habitation for a longer period than a few weeks.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now, do the known facts of Thomas Lyttelton's life correspond with
  this statement or not? The reviewer says, p. 115.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For a period of three years after Mr. Lyttelton lost his seat<a
  name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&mdash;<i>that
  period during which Junius wrote his acknowledged
  compositions</i>&mdash;we hardly find a trace of him in any of the
  contemporaneous letters or memoirs that have fallen under our
  observation."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But how is it, let me ask, that the author of the review has so
  studiously avoided all mention of one work, which would at once have
  furnished traces of Thomas Lyttelton at this very period? I allude to the
  volume of <i>Poems by a Young Nobleman of distinguished Abilities, lately
  deceased</i>, published by G. Kearsley: London, 1780, 4to. Does not this
  look much like the <i>suppressio veri</i> which follows close on the
  footsteps of the <i>assertio falsi</i>? It is hardly credible that the
  reviewer should not be acquainted with this book, for he refers to the
  lines spoken in 1765, at Stowe, in the character of Queen Mab, which form
  part of its contents; and the existence of the work is expressly pointed
  out by Chalmers, and noticed by Lowndes, Watt, and other bibliographers.
  Among the poems here published, are some which ought to have received a
  prominent notice from the author of the review, if he had fairly stated
  the case. These are:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. Lines "to G&mdash;&mdash;e Ed&mdash;&mdash;d Ays&mdash;&mdash;gh,
  Esq., [George Edward Ayscough, cousin to Thomas Lyttelton] <i>from
  Venice, the 20th July, 1770</i>."&mdash;P. 22.</p>

  <p>2. "An Irregular Ode, <i>wrote at Vicenza, in Italy, the 20th of
  August, 1770</i>."&mdash;P. 29.</p>

  <p>3. "On Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, <i>at Venice, in J&mdash;&mdash;,
  1770</i>."</p>

  <p>4. "An Invitation to Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;a D&mdash;&mdash;, <i>wrote
  at Ghent in Flanders, the 23rd of March, 1769</i>."&mdash;P. 41.</p>

  <p>5. "<i>An Extempore, by Lord Lyttelton, in Italy, anno
  1770</i>."&mdash;P. 48.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Admitting that these poems are genuine, it is evident that their
  author, Thomas Lyttelton, was abroad in Flanders and Italy during the
  years 1769 and 1770; and consequently could not have been the mysterious
  Junius, who in those years (particularly in 1769) was writing constantly
  in or near London to Woodfall and the <i>Public Advertiser</i>. Of what
  value then is the assertion so confidently made by the reviewer (p.
  133.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The position of Thomas Lyttelton in the five years from 1767 to 1772,
  is exactly such a one as it is reasonable to suppose that Junius held
  during the period of his writings;"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>or how can it be made to agree with the fact of his residence on the
  Continent during the greater part of the time?</p>

<p><!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>{32}</span></p>

  <p>The reviewer, indeed, tells us that "just as Junius concluded his
  great work, Thomas Lyttelton returned to his father's house, and Chatham
  was one of the first to congratulate Lord Lyttelton on the event." This
  was in February 1772; and in the <i>Chatham Correspondence</i>, vol. iv.
  p. 195., is Lord Lyttelton's letter of thanks in reply. The reviewer
  would evidently have it inferred, that Thomas Lyttelton had returned home
  like a prodigal son, after a temporary estrangement, and from a
  comparatively short distance; but surely, had the volume of <i>Poems</i>
  been referred to, it might or rather <i>must</i> have occurred to a
  candid inquirer, that in February 1772 Thomas Lyttelton returned from his
  <i>travels on the Continent, after an absence of nearly three years</i>!
  But, perhaps, the authenticity of the <i>Poems</i> may at once be boldly
  denied? Is this the case? Chalmers certainly includes them with the
  <i>Letters</i>, as having been "disowned" by Lord L.'s executors; but
  says, "as to the <i>Poems</i>, they added, '<i>great part whereof are
  undoubtedly spurious</i>.'" It is certain, therefore, that <i>some</i> of
  the <i>Poems</i> are genuine; and it is a pity that the exceptions were
  not specified, as the discussion might then have been confined within
  narrower limits. The editor of the <i>Poems</i>, in his address "To the
  Reader," writes thus in vindication of them:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is scarcely a line in the collection which does not bear
  testimony of its origin; the <i>places and dates</i> are also strong
  corroborations to such of his friends as he corresponded with <i>on his
  last journey across the Alps</i>. His style was elegant, and his ideas so
  animated, that <i>spurious productions would be immediately
  detected</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is the testimony of one who "had the honour of his friendship,
  which terminated only with his death," and is not to be lightly
  rejected.<a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> My
  own conviction is in favour of the authenticity of the whole; but, at all
  events, I shall be able to offer undoubted evidence as to the genuineness
  of part of the volume, and additional proof that the author was abroad at
  the precise time when, if he were Junius, he must have resided in this
  country. By Thomas Lord Lyttelton's will (dated Oct. 30, 1777), he
  appointed as his executors his brother-in-law Arthur Viscount Valentia,
  his uncle William Henry Lord Westcote, and Wilson Aylesbury Roberts of
  Bewdley. To the latter he left all his "letters, verses, speeches, and
  writings," with directions that, if published, it should be for his sole
  emolument. The important Query therefore at once arises, <i>what became
  of these manuscripts, and were they destroyed or preserved</i>?</p>

  <p>The above Mr. Roberts was an intimate personal friend; and from his
  local influence as bailiff and deputy-recorder of Bewdley, had no doubt
  contributed towards Thomas Lyttelton's return for that borough in 1768.
  His son continued to keep up a close connexion with the Valentia family
  at Arley Hall<a name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>;
  and this fact, coupled with the close proximity of Bewdley, Arley, and
  Hagley, and the circumstance of the co-executorship of Lord Valentia and
  Mr. Roberts, would make us naturally look to the library at Arley as a
  not unlikely place of deposit for Thomas Lyttelton's papers. This is not
  mere conjecture, and brings me immediately to the point at issue: for, at
  the sale of the Valentia Library at Arley Castle, in December last, a
  manuscript volume made its appearance in a lot with others thus
  designated:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Original Diary of Travels [of Lord Valentia] 4 vols.; Five Memorandum
  Books of Journeys and Travels; also <i>Two Old Folio Volumes of Original
  Poetic Pieces</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>One of the folio volumes thus catalogued subsequently came into my
  hands, and is evidently one of the manuscripts left by Thomas Lord
  Lyttelton's will to the care of Mr. Roberts, since it consists wholly of
  pieces in verse and prose of his composition, written either <i>in his
  own hand</i>, as rough draughts, or copied (apparently by a female
  scribe) and afterwards <i>corrected by himself</i>. Among the poetry in
  this MS. I find the greater part of the long poem printed in the edition
  of 1780, p. 1., entitled "The State of England in the year 2199," which
  is without date in the MS., but in the edition bears date March 21, 1771;
  as likewise the "Invitation to Miss Warb[u]rt[o]n," edit. p. 35.,
  which appears in the MS. without any name; and the "Extempore Rhapsody,
  March 21, 1771," edit. p. 37., also undated in the MS., but which
  supplies the name of "Yates," expressed in the edition by asterisks; and
  also six lines at the end, which were omitted in the edition on account
  of their indecency. There are several variations in the manuscript, which
  prove that some other copy was followed by the printer; and many
  typographical errors in the edition may hence be corrected. Besides these
  poems, the following pieces constitute the chief contents of this
  manuscript volume:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Draughts of four letters <i>written by Thomas Lyttelton from Lyons,
  the first of which is dated September</i> 10, 1769.</p>

  <p>Heads of a series of Dialogues, in imitation of "Dialogues of the
  Dead," by his father George, first Lord Lyttelton.</p>

  <p>Poetical Fragments, imitated from Lucretius.</p>

<p><!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span></p>

  <p>Two letters addressed by Thomas Lyttelton to his father; and a third
  to "Dear George," probably his cousin George Edward Ayscough.</p>

  <p>Some Latin lines, not remarkable for their delicacy.</p>

  <p>Political letter, <i>written from Milan</i>, by Thomas Lyttelton; in
  which indignant notice is taken of the commital of Brass Crossby, Lord
  Mayor, <i>which took place in March, 1771</i>.</p>

  <p>Fragment of a poem on Superstition, and various other unfinished
  poetical scraps.</p>

  <p>Private memoranda of expenses.</p>

  <p>A page of writing in a fictitious or short-hand character, of which I
  can make nothing.</p>

  <p>Remarks, in prose, on the polypus, priestcraft, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Poem in French, of an amatory character.</p>

  <p>Portion of a remarkable political letter, containing some bitter
  remarks by Thomas Lyttelton on the "first minister." He ends thus: "The
  play now draws to a conclusion. I am guilty of a breach of trust in
  telling him so, but I shall [not] suffer by my indiscretion, for it is an
  absolute impossibility any man should divine who is the author of the
  letter signed <span class="sc">Aruspex</span>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It would appear from the water-mark in the paper of which this MS. is
  composed, that it was procured in Italy; and there can be little or no
  doubt it was used by Thomas Lyttelton as a draught-book, during his
  travels there in 1769-1771; during which period, nearly the whole of the
  contents seem to have been written. The evidence afforded therefore by
  this volume, comes peculiarly in support of the dates and other
  circumstances put forth in the printed volume of <i>Poems</i>; and leads
  us inevitably to the conclusion, <i>that it was utterly impossible for
  Thomas Lyttelton to have had any share in the Letters of Junius</i>. He
  has enough to answer for on the score of his early profligacy and
  scepticism, without being dragged from the grave to be arraigned for the
  crime of deceit. His heart need not, according to the reviewer, be
  "stripped bare" by the scalpel of any literary anatomist; but he may be
  left to that quiet and oblivion which a sepulchre in general bestows.
  Before I conclude these remarks (which I fear are too diffuse), I will
  venture to add a few words in regard to the signature of Thomas Lord
  Lyttelton. In the <i>Chatham Correspondence</i>, a letter from him to
  Earl Temple is printed, vol. iv. p. 348., the signature to which is
  printed <span class="sc">Lyttleton</span>, and the editors point out in a
  note the "alteration adopted" in the spelling of the name; but it is
  altogether an error, for the fac-simile of this signature in vol. iv. p.
  29., as well as his will in the Prerogative Court, prove that he wrote
  his name <i>Lyttelton</i>, in the same manner as his father and uncle. As
  to the resemblance pointed out by the author of the <i>Review</i> between
  the handwriting of Thomas Lyttelton and that of Junius, it exists only in
  imagination, since there is really no similitude whatever between
  them.</p>

  <p>Some Queries are now annexed, in reference to what has been above
  discussed:</p>

  <p>1. In what publication or in what form did the executors of Thomas
  Lord Lyttelton disown the <i>Letters</i> and <i>Poems</i>?</p>

  <p>2. Is it known who was the editor of the <i>Poems</i> published in
  1780?</p>

  <p>3. Can the present representative of the family of Roberts give any
  farther information respecting Thomas Lord Lyttelton's manuscripts?</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Lord Chatham.</i>&mdash;I would suggest as a Query, whether Lord
  Chatham's famous comparison of the Fox and Newcastle ministry to the
  confluence of the Rhone and Saone at Lyons (<i>Speech</i>, Nov. 13,
  1755), was not adapted from a passage in Lord Roscommon's <i>Essay on
  translated Verse</i>. Possibly Lord Chatham may have merely quoted the
  lines of Roscommon, and reporters may have converted his quotation into
  prose. Lord Chatham (then of course Mr. Pitt) is represented to have
  said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>I remember</i> at Lyons to have been carried to the conflux of the
  Rhone and the Soane: the one a gentle, feeble, languid stream, and,
  though languid, of no depth; the other, a boisterous and <i>impetuous</i>
  torrent."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Lord Roscommon says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thus <i>have I seen</i> a rapid headlong tide,</p>
      <p>With foaming waves the passive Saone divide,</p>

      <p>While he, with eager force, urg'd his <i>impetuous</i> way."</p>

  <p><i>Sir Isaac Newton and Voltaire on Railway
  Travelling.</i>&mdash;Having been forcibly impressed by a <!-- Page 35
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span>paragraph in a
  popular periodical (<i>The Leisure Hour</i>, No. 72.), I am desirous of
  learning upon what authority the statements therein depend. As, perhaps,
  it may also prove interesting to some of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." who
  may not already have seen it, and in the hope that some of your
  contributors may be able to throw a light upon so curious a subject, I
  herewith transcribe it:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Sir Isaac Newton and Voltaire on Railway Travelling.</i>&mdash;Sir
  Isaac Newton wrote a work upon the prophet Daniel, and another upon the
  book of Revelation, in one of which he said that in order to fulfil
  certain prophecies before a certain date was terminated, namely, 1260
  years, there would be a mode of travelling of which the men of his time
  had no conception; nay, that the knowledge of mankind would be so
  increased, that they would be able to travel at the rate of fifty miles
  an hour. Voltaire, who did not believe in the inspiration of the
  scriptures, got hold of this, and said 'Now look at that mighty mind of
  Newton, who discovered gravity, and told us such marvels for us all to
  admire. When he became an old man, and got into his dotage, he began to
  study that book called the Bible; and it seems, that in order to credit
  its fabulous nonsense, we must believe that the knowledge of mankind will
  be so increased that we shall be able to travel at the rate of fifty
  miles an hour. The poor dotard!' exclaimed the philosophic infidel
  Voltaire, in the self-complacency of his pity. But who is the dotard
  now?&mdash;<i>Rev. J. Craig.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Query I would more particularly ask is (presuming the accuracy of
  the assertions), What is the prophecy so wonderfully fulfilled?</p>

  <p class="author">R. W.</p>

  <p><i>Tom Thumb's House at Gonerby, Lincolnshire.</i>&mdash;On the
  south-west side of the tower of the church of Great Gonerby,
  Lincolnshire, is a curious cornice representing a house with a door in
  the centre, an oriel window, &amp;c., which is popularly called "Tom
  Thumb's Castle." I have a small engraving of it ("W.&nbsp;T. del. 1820, R.&nbsp;R.
  sculpt."): and a pencil states that on the same tower are other "curious
  carvings."</p>

  <p>I would ask, therefore, Why carved? From what event or occasion? For
  whom? Why called "Tom Thumb's House?" And what are the other curious
  carvings?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">G. Creed.</span></p>

  <p><i>Mr. Payne Collier's Monovolume Shakspeare.</i>&mdash;I should be
  extremely obliged to <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>, if he would
  kindly give me a public reply to the following question.</p>

  <p>The express terms of the publication of his monovolune edition of
  Shakspeare, as advertised, were&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The text regulated by the <i>old copies</i>, and by the <i>recently
  discovered folio of 1632</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These terms manifestly exclude corrections from any other source <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `that'.">than</span> those of
  <i>collation of the old copies</i>, and the <i>MS. corrections</i> of the
  folio of 1632.</p>

  <p>Now the text of <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> monovolume
  reprint contains many of the emendations of the commentators <i>not</i>
  referred to in <i>Notes and Emendations</i>. For example: in <i>The
  Taming of the Shrew</i>, where Biondello runs in to announce the coming
  down the hill of the "ancient angel" (changed by the corrector into
  <i>ambler</i>), two other alterations in the same sentence appear without
  explanation in the <i>regulated text</i>, namely, <i>mercatante</i>
  substituted by Steevens for "marcantant" of the folios; and <i>surely</i>
  in lieu of "surly," which latter is the word of <i>the folio of
  1632</i>.</p>

  <p>I now ask <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>, on what authority were
  these emendations adopted?</p>

<h3>WILD PLANTS AND THEIR NAMES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 175. 233.)</p>

  <p>Perhaps the following may prove of some use to <span
  class="sc">Enivri</span>, in reply to his Query respecting the names of
  certain wild flowers.</p>

  <p>1. Shepherd's Purse (<i>Bursa pastoris</i>). "Sic dict. a folliculis
  seminum, qui crumenulam referre videntur." Also called Poor Man's
  Parmacitty, "Quia ad contusos et casu afflictos instar spermatis ceti
  utile est." Also St. James's Wort, "Quia circa ejus festum florescit,"
  July 28th. Also called Pick-purse.</p>

  <p>2. Eye-bright, according to Skinner (<i>Euphrasia</i>), Teut.
  <i>Augentrost</i>; "Oculorum solamen, quia visum eximiÃ¨ acuit." Fluellin
  (<i>Veronica femina</i>), "Forte a Leolino aliquo Cambro-Brit. ejus
  inventore."</p>

  <p>3. Pass Wort, or Palsy Wort (<i>Primula veris</i>). "Herba
  paralyseos."</p>

  <p>4. Guelder Rose (<i>Sambucus rosea</i>). "Quia ex GueldriÃ¢ huc
  translata est." Gueldria is, or rather was, a colony, founded by the
  Hollanders, on the coast of Coromandel.</p>

  <p>5. Ladies' Tresses, a corruption of <i>traces</i>. A kind of orchis,
  and used, with its various appellations, "sensu obsc."</p>

  <p>6. The Kentish term <i>Gazel</i> is not improbably the same as
  <i>Gale</i>, which, Skinner says, is from the A.-S. <i>Gagel</i>
  (<i>Myrtus brabantica</i>).</p>

  <p>7. Stitch Wort (<i>Gramen leucanthemum</i>, alias <i>Holostium
  pumilum</i>). "Sic dict. quia ad dolores laterum punctorios multum
  prodesse creditur."</p>

  <p>8. The term <i>Knappert</i>, for Bitter Vetch, is probably a
  corruption of Knap Wort, the first syllable of which, as in Knap Weed and
  Knap Bottle, is derived from the sound or snap emitted by it when struck
  in the hollow of the hand.</p>

  <p>9. Charlock (<i>Rapum sylvestre</i>); Anglo-Saxon <i>Cerlice</i>. <!--
  Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>{36}</span></p>

  <p>10. London Pride or Tufts (<i>Armeria prolifera</i>). "Sic dict. quia
  flores propter pulchritudinem Londini valdÃ¨ expetuntur." (?)</p>

  <p>11. Avens; also Herb Bennet (<i>Caryophyllata</i>). Skinner says,
  "Herba Benedicta ab insigni radicis vulnerariÃ¢ vi." (?)</p>

  <p>12. Mill Mountain, or Purge Flax (<i>Linum sylvestre catharticum</i>,
  or <i>ChamÃ¦linum</i>). "Montibus gaudet."</p>

  <p>13. Jack of the Buttery. "<i>Sedi</i> species sic dict. quia in tecto
  galacterii crescit." Pricket: "a sapore acri."</p>

  <p>14. Cudweed or Cotton Weed; Live-long. "Quia planta perennis est."</p>

  <p>15. Sun Spurge. "Quia flores ad ortum solis se aperiunt." Churn Staff,
  from its similarity.</p>

  <p>16. Welcome to our House (<i>Tithymalus Cyparissias</i>). "Ob
  pulchritudinem suam omnibus expetitus."</p>

  <p>17. Ruddes (<i>Fl. CalendulÃ¦</i>). "A colore aureo." Wild or Corn
  Marigold. "Q. d. aurum MariÃ¦, a colore sc. floris luteo." Gouls or
  Goulans, with a half-suppressed <i>d</i>, may very well be supposed to
  indicate its natural name&mdash;Gold. Another name of this plant is
  Lockron, or Locker Goulans.</p>

  <p>18. Spurry (<i>Spergula</i>). "Sic dict. quia folia ejus octo,
  angusta, stelliformia, radios calcaris satis exactÃ¨ referunt."</p>

  <p>19. Mercury Goose-foot. Probably a goose-foot resembling Mercury
  (<i>Mercurialis</i>), a herb concerning which Skinner doubts, but
  suggests, "Quia Mercurio, ut ceterÃ¦ omnes plantÃ¦ planetis, appropriata
  sit." Another name is Good Henry,&mdash;I find not Good <i>King</i>
  Henry&mdash;(<i>Lapathum unctuosum</i>), "A commodo ejus usu in
  enematis." It is also called All-good, forasmuch as it is useful, not
  only for its medicinal qualities, but also in supplying the table with a
  substitute for other vegetables, such as asparagus.</p>

  <p>A plant termed in this country Gang Flower is the same as Rogation
  Flower, recalling the perambulation of parishes on one of those days.
  There is a vast fund of interesting matter in these old names of wild
  flowers (mixed up, of course, with much that is trifling); and I
  cordially agree with your correspondent, that it is well worth a steady
  effort to rescue the fast-fading traditions relating to them. It must be
  confessed, however, that the obstacles in the way of tracing the original
  meaning and supposed virtues, will in many instances be found very great,
  arising principally from the fanciful translations and corruptions which
  our ancestors made of the old names. Take, for instance, the
  following:</p>

  <p>Loose Strife or Herb Willow, from <i>Lysimachia</i>, the original
  being undoubtedly a man's name, Lysimachus.</p>

  <p>Ale-hoof (<i>Hedera terrestris</i>). Anglo-Saxon <i>Al behÃ³fian</i>.
  "Herba <span title="panchrÃªstos" class="grk"
  >&pi;&#x1F71;&gamma;&chi;&rho;&eta;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  ad multos usus efficacissima."</p>

  <p>Herb Ambrose has a Greek origin, <span title="ambrotos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F04;&mu;&beta;&rho;&omicron;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, and is
  not indebted to the saint of that name.</p>

  <p>Comfrey or Cumfrey. "Herba vulnera <i>conferruminans</i>;" good for
  joining the edges of a wound.</p>

  <p>Calathian Violets. Simply cupped violets, from <span title="kalathos" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F71;&lambda;&alpha;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>.</p>

  <p>Brank Ursin (<i>Acanthus</i>). "It. brancha, unguis ursinus."</p>

  <p>Blood Strange; properly, <i>String</i>. To stanch.</p>

  <p>Bertram. A corruption of <span title="purethron" class="grk"
  >&pi;&#x1F7B;&rho;&epsilon;&theta;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</span>
  (<i>Pyrethrum</i>).</p>

  <p>Spreusidany, Hair-strong, Sulphur Wort. Corrupted from
  <i>Peucedanum</i>.</p>

  <p>Pell-a-mountain, Wild Thyme. From <i>Serpyllum montanum</i>.</p>

  <p>Faceless. From <i>Phaseolus</i>, dim. of <i>Phaselus</i>; so called
  from its shallop shape.</p>

  <p>Stick-a-dove, French Lavender. From <span title="stoichas, stoichados" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&iota;&chi;&#x1F70;&sigmaf;,
  &sigma;&tau;&omicron;&iota;&chi;&#x1F71;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>St&oelig;chas</i>; so called from the <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `irregularity', corrected by errata in Issue 194."
  >regularity</span> of the petals.</p>

  <p>Such instances might be multiplied to almost any extent.</p>

  <p>There is, doubtless, a good deal of scattered information respecting
  old English wild flowers to be met with, not only in books, but also
  among our rural population, stored up by village sages. Contributions of
  this description would surely be welcome in "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p class="author">H. C. K.</p>

  <p class="address">&mdash;&mdash; Rectory, Hereford.</p>

  <p>Herbs of all kinds were, some two hundred years ago, esteemed of much
  value as medicine; for in a curious, and I believe rather scarce,
  pharmacop&oelig;ia by Wm. Salmon, date 1693, I find some 414 pages
  devoted to their uses. This pharmacop&oelig;ia, or <i>Compleat English
  Physician</i>, was dedicated to Mary, second Queen of England, Scotland,
  France, Ireland, &amp;c., and appears to have been the first. The preface
  says "it was the first of that kind extant in the world, a subject for
  which we have no precedent."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I have not trusted," he says, "to the reports of authors, but have
  wrote as an eye-witness in describing most things therein; and it is
  nothing but what I know and have learnt by daily experience for thirty
  years together, so that my prescriptions may in some measure plead a
  privilege above the performances of other men."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>1. <i>Capsella</i> (<i>Bursa pastoris</i>) he describes as cold
  1<sup>o</sup>, and dry in 2<sup>o</sup>, binding and astringent. Good
  against spitting of blood or hÃ¦morrhage of the nose, and other fluxes of
  the bowels. The leaves, of which &#x292;j. in powder may be given. The
  juice inspissate, drunk with wine, helps ague. A cataplasm applied in
  inflammations, Anthony's fire, &amp;c., represses them.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Veronica ChamÃ¦drys</i> he calls <i>Euphrasia</i>,
  <i>Euphrosunee</i>, and says it is much commended by Arnoldus de Villa
  Nova, who asserts that it not only helps dimness of the sight, but the
  use of it <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page37"></a>{37}</span>makes old men to read small letters without
  spectacles, who could scarcely read great letters with spectacles before;
  but that it did restore their sight who had been a long time blind. Truly
  a most wonderful plant; and, if he freely used it, must have been a great
  drawback to spectacle-makers.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Primula veris</i>, he says, more properly belongs to the
  primrose than cowslip. The root is haumatic, and helps pains in the back.
  The herb is cephalic, neurotic, and arthritic. The juice or essence, with
  spirits of wine, stops all manner of fluxes, is excellent against palsy,
  gout, and pains, and distempers of the nerves and joints. A cataplasm of
  the juice, with rye meal, is good against luxations and ruptures. The
  flowers are good against palsy, numbness, convulsions, and cramps, being
  given in a sulphurous or a saline tincture, or an oily tincture, or an
  essence of the juice with spirits of wine. The juice of the flowers, or
  an ointment of the <i>flower</i> or its juice, cleanses the skin from
  spots, though the worthy old physician only gives a receipt for making
  essence as follows: Beat the whole plant well in a mortar; add to it an
  equal quantity of brandy or spirits of wine; close up tight in a large
  bolt-head, and set it to digest in a very gentle sand-heat for three
  months. Strain out all the liquor, which close up in a bolt-head again,
  and digest in a gentle sand-heat for two months more. Rather a
  troublesome and slow process this.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Geum urbanum</i> he calls <i>Caryophyllata</i>, <i>Herba
  benedicta</i>, and <i>Geum Plinii</i>, and should be gathered, he says,
  in the middle of March, for then it smells sweetest, and is most
  aromatic. Hot and dry in the 2<sup>o</sup>, binding, strengthening,
  discussive, cephalic, neurotic, and cardiac. Is a good preservative
  against epidemic and contagious disease; helps digestion. The powder of
  the root, dose &#x292;j. The decoction, in wine, stops spitting of blood,
  dose &#x292;ss to &#x292;jss. The saline tincture opens all obstructions
  of the viscera, dose &#x292;j to &#x292;iij.</p>

  <p>Should <span class="sc">Enivri</span> wish to know the medical virtues
  of our wild plants, I have no doubt but that this worthy old physician
  will tell him what virtues they were considered to possess in his day, at
  least by himself; and I can assure him that 1195 of the <i>English
  Physician's</i> pages ascribe marvellous properties, not only to plants,
  but to animals, fish, and even the bones of a stag's heart.</p>

<h3>JACOB BOBART.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 428. 578.)</p>

  <p>I am exceedingly obliged for the information afforded by <span
  class="sc">Dr. E.&nbsp;F. Rimbault</span> concerning the Bobarts. Can he give
  me any more communication concerning them? I am anxious to learn all I
  can. I have old Jacob Bobart's signature, bearing date 1659, in which he
  spells his name with an <i>e</i> instead of <i>a</i>, which seems to have
  been altered to an <i>a</i> by his son Jacob.</p>

  <p>In <i>Vertumnus</i> it says Bobart's <i>Hortes Siccus</i> was in
  twenty volumes; but the <i>Oxford Botanic Garden Guide</i> only mentions
  twelve quarto volumes: which is correct, and where is it? In one of my
  copies of <i>Vertumnus</i>, a scrap of paper is fixed to p. 29., and the
  following is written upon it:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Hortus Siccus here alluded to was sold at the Rev. Mr.
  Hodgkinson's sale at Sarsden, to Mrs. De Salis, wife of Dr. De
  Salis."</p>

<h3>HERALDIC QUERIES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 571.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ceyrep</span> is informed, 1st, That a shield in the
  form of a lozenge was appropriated exclusively to females, both spinsters
  and widows, in order to distinguish the sex of the bearer of a coat of
  arms. It is of doubtful origin, though supposed, from the form, to
  symbolise the spindle with yarn wound round it; of good authority, and
  not of very modern date. Many instances may be seen in Fuller, in the
  coats of arms appended to the dedications of the various chapters of his
  <i>Church History</i>. In sect. ii. book vi. p. 282. ed. 1655, he has
  separated the coats of man and wife, and placed them side by side; that
  of the latter upon a lozenge-shaped shield&mdash;Party per pale arg. and
  gules, two eagles displayed, counterchanged.</p>

  <p>2ndly, No one has a right to inscribe a motto upon a garter or riband,
  except those dignified with one of the various orders of knighthood. For
  any other person to do so, is a silly assumption. The motto should be
  upon a scroll, either over the crest, or beneath the shield.</p>

  <p>3rdly, I cannot find that it was ever the custom in this country for
  ecclesiastics to bear their paternal coat on an oval or circular shield.
  Forbidden, as they were, by the first council of <!-- Page 38 --><span

  warfare, it is a question whether any below the episcopal order ought, in
  strict right, to display any armorial ensigns at all. Archbishops and
  bishops bear the arms of their sees impaled (as of their spouse) with
  their own paternal coats; the latter probably only in right of their
  baronies. It is worthy of remark that, since the Reformation, and
  consequent marriage of bishops, there has been no official decision as to
  the bearing the arms of their wives, nor has any precedence been granted
  to the latter.</p>

<h3>DOOR-HEAD INSCRIPTIONS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 23. 190. 585.)</p>

  <p>A few years ago I copied the following inscription from over the door
  of the residence of a parish priest at Cologne:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Protege Deus parochiam hanc propter</p>

      <p class="i6"><span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1787."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>From the gateway leading into the Villa Borghese, just outside of the
  "Porta del Popolo," at Rome, I copied the following:</p>

<p class="cenhead">"VillÃ¦ BurghesiÃ¦ PincianÃ¦<br />

  <p>On the entrance into the Villa Medici are the two following:</p>

<h3>CONSECRATED ROSES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 407. 480.)</p>

  <p>I forward the accompanying observations on the origin of the Rosa
  d'Oro, in compliance with the request contained at page 480. of the 185th
  No. of "N. &amp; Q.," in case they should not have come under your
  observation. They are to be found in <i>Histoire de Lorraine</i>, par
  R.&nbsp;P. Dom. Calmet: Nancy, 1745.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Le troisiÃ¨me monastÃ¨re fondÃ© par les parens de St. Leon est l'Abbaye
  de Volfenheim, Ã  deux lieues de Colmar, vers le Midi, et Ã  deux lieues
  environs d'Egesheim, chÃ¢teau des Comtes de Dasbourg, aujourd'hui (1745)
  inhabitÃ©, mais bien remarquable par ces vastes ruines, sur le sommet des
  montagnes qui dominent sur l'Alsace.</p>

  <p>"Volfenheim Ã©toit un village considÃ©rable, Ã  une lieue et demi de
  Colmar. On voie encore aujourd'hui Ã  une demi lieue de Sainte Croix dans
  les champs, l'Ã©glise qui lui servoit autrefois de paroisse. L'abbaye
  Ã©toit Ã  quelque distance de lÃ , au lieu oÃ¹ est aujourd'hui le bourg de
  Sainte Croix.</p>

  <p>"Volfenheim ayant Ã©toit [<i>QuÃ¦re</i>, Ã©tÃ©] ruinÃ© par les guerres, les
  habitans se sont insensiblement Ã©tablis autour de l'abbaye, ce qui a
  formÃ© un bon bourg, connu sous le nom de Sainte Croix; parceque l'abbaye
  Ã©toit consacrÃ©e sous cette invocation. Le Pape Leon IX., dans la Bulle
  qu'il donna Ã  ce monastÃ¨re la premiÃ¨re annÃ©e de son pontificat, de J.&nbsp;C.
  1049, nous apprend qu'il avoit Ã©tÃ© fondÃ© par son pÃ¨re Hughes et sa mÃ¨re
  Heilioilgdis, et ses frÃ¨res Gerard et Hugues, qui Ã©toient dÃ©jÃ  dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©s;
  il ajoÃ»te que ce lieu lui Ã©toit tombÃ© par droit de succession; il le met
  sous la protection spÃ©ciale du Saint SiÃ©ge, en sorte que nulle personne,
  de quelque qualitÃ© qu'elle soit, n'y exerce aucune autoritÃ©, mais qu'il
  jouisse d'une pleine libertÃ©, et que l'abbesse et les religieuses
  puissent employer quelque evÃªque ils jugeroient apropos pour les
  bÃ©nÃ©dictions d'autels, et autres fonctions qui regardent le ministÃ¨re
  Ã©piscopal: que son neveu, le Comte Henri Seigneur d'Egesheim, en soit la
  voue, et aprÃ¨s lui, l'aÃ®nÃ© des Seigneurs d'Egesheim Ã  perpÃ©tuitÃ©.</p>

  <p>"Que si cette race vient Ã  manquer, l'abbesse et le couvent choisiront
  quelque autre de la parentÃ© de ces <!-- Page 39 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>{39}</span>seigneurs, afin que
  l'avocatie ne soit pas de leur race, et qu'aprÃ¨s la mort de Kuentza, qui
  en Ã©toit abbesse, et Ã  qui le Pape avoit donnÃ© la bÃ©nÃ©diction abbatiale,
  les religieuses choisissent de leur communautÃ©, ou d'ailleurs, celle qui
  leur paroÃ®tra la plus propre, reservant toujours au Pape le droit de la
  bÃ©nir. Et en reconnaissance d'un privilÃ¨ge si singulier, l'abbesse
  donnera tous les ans au Saint SiÃ©ge une Rose d'Or du poids de deux onces
  Romaines. Elle l'envoyera toute faite, ou en envoyera la matiÃ¨re
  prÃ©parÃ©e, de telle sorte qu'elle soit rendue au Pape huit jours
  auparavant qu'il la porte, c'est-Ã -dire, le Dimanche de CarÃªme, oÃ¹ l'on
  chante Ã  l'Introite, 'Oculi mei semper ad Dominum;' afin qu'il puisse
  bÃ©nir au Dimanche 'LÃ¦tare,' qui est le quatriÃ¨me du CarÃªme. Telle est
  l'origine de la Rose d'Or, que le Pape bÃ©nit encore aujourd'hui le
  quatriÃ¨me Dimanche de CarÃªme, nommÃ© 'LÃ¦tare,' et qu'il envoye Ã  quelque
  prince pour marque d'estime et de bienveillance. Ce jour-lÃ , la station
  se fait Ã  Sainte Croix de JÃ©rusalem. Le Pape, accompagnÃ© des cardinaux,
  vetÃ»s de couleur de rose, marche en cavalcade Ã  l'eglise, tenant la Rose
  d'Or Ã  la main. Il la porte, allant Ã  l'autel, chargÃ© de baume et de
  mare. Il la quitte au 'Confiteor,' et la reprend aprÃ¨s 'l'Introite.' Il
  en fait la BÃ©nÃ©diction, et aprÃ¨s l'Evangile, il monte en chaise et
  explique les propriÃ©tÃ©s de la rose. AprÃ¨s la Messe il retourne en
  cavalcade Ã  son palais, ayant toujours la Rose en main et la couronne sur
  la tÃªte. On appelle ce Dimanche 'Pascha rosata,' ou 'LÃ¦tare.'</p>

  <p>"Nous avons encore un sermon du Pape Innocent III., composÃ© en cette
  occasion, an commencement du treiziÃ¨me siÃ¨cle. Le Pape Nicholas IV., en
  1290, dans le dÃ©nombrement qu'il fait des Ã©glises qui doivent des
  redevances Ã  l'Ã©glise de Rome, met le monastÃ¨re de Sainte Croix, diocÃ¨se
  de Basle, qui doit deux onces d'or pour la Rose d'Or, qui se bÃ©nit au

<h3>NOTES ON SERPENTS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 130.; Vol. vi., p. 177.&mdash;Vol. iii., p. 490.; Vol. vi., pp. 42. 147.)</p>

  <p>Loskiel, in his account of the Moravian missions to the North American
  Indians<a name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, tells
  us that,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Indians are remarkably skilled in curing the bite of venomous
  serpents, and have found a medicine peculiarly adapted to the bite of
  each species. For example, the leaf of the Rattlesnake-root (<i>Polygala
  senega</i>) is the most efficacious remedy against the bite of this
  dreadful animal. God has mercifully granted it to grow in the greatest
  plenty in all parts most infested by the rattlesnake. It is very
  remarkable that this herb acquires its greatest perfection just at the
  time when the bite of these serpents is the most dangerous.... Virginian
  Snake-root (<i>Aristolochia serpentaria</i>) chewed, makes also an
  excellent poultice for wounds of this sort.... The fat of the serpent
  itself, rubbed into the wound, is thought to be efficacious. The flesh of
  the rattlesnake, dried and boiled to a broth, is said to be more
  nourishing than that of the viper, and of service in consumptions. Their
  gall is likewise used as medicine."&mdash;P. 146.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Pigs are excepted from the dreadful effects of their bite; they will
  even attack and eat them. It is said that, <i>if a rattlesnake is
  irritated and cannot be revenged, it bites itself, and dies in a few
  hours</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Wird dieses Thier zornig gemacht, und es kann sich nicht rÃ¤chen, so
  beiszt es sich selbst, und in wenig Stunden ist es todt."&mdash;P. 113.<a
  name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"I have seen some of our Canadians eat these rattlesnakes repeatedly.
  The flesh is very white, and they assured me had a delicious taste. Their
  manner of dressing them is very simple.... Great caution, however, is
  required in killing a snake for eating; for if the first blow fails, or
  only partially stuns him, <i>he instantly bites himself in different
  parts of the body, which thereby become poisoned</i>, and would prove
  fatal to any person who should partake of it."&mdash;Cox's <i>Adv. on the
  Columbia River</i>: Lond. 1832, p. 74.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Fordyce knew the black servant of an Indian merchant in America,
  who was fond of soup made of rattlesnakes, in which he always boiled the
  head along with the rest of the animal, without any regard to the
  poisons."&mdash;Rees's <i>CyclopÃ¦dia</i>.</p>

  <p>"There is a religious sect in Africa, not far from Algiers, which eat
  the most venomous serpents <i>alive</i>; and certainly, it is said,
  without extracting their fangs. They declare they enjoy the privilege
  from their founder. The creatures writhe and struggle between their
  teeth; but possibly, if they do bite them, the bite is innocuous."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mrs. Crowe, in the concluding chapter of her <i>Night-side of
  Nature</i>, gives the testimony of an eye-witness to "the singular
  phenomenon to be observed by placing a scorpion and a mouse together
  under a glass."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is known that <i>stags renew their age by eating serpents</i>; so
  the ph&oelig;nix is restored by the nest of spices she makes to burn in.
  The pelican hath the same virtue, whose right foot, if it be put under
  hot dung, after three months a pelican will be bred from it. Wherefore
  some physicians, with some confections made of <i>a viper</i> and
  hellebore, and of some of the flesh of these creatures, <i>do promise to
  restore youth, and sometimes they do it</i>."<a name="footnotetag7"
  href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On reading any of our old herbalists, one would imagine that serpents
  (and those of the worst kind) abounded in "Merrie Englande," and that
  they were the greatest bane of our lives. It is <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span>hard to stumble on a
  plant that is not an antidote to the bite of serpents. Our old herbals
  were compiled, however, almost entirely from the writings of the
  ancients, and from foreign sources. The ancients had a curious notion
  relative to the plant Basil (<i>Oscimum basilicum</i>), viz., "That there
  is a property in Basil to propagate scorpions, and that the smell thereof
  they are bred in the brains of men." Others deny this wonderful property,
  and make Basil a simple antidote.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"According unto Oribasius, physician unto Julian, the Africans, men
  best experienced in poisons, affirm, whosoever hath eaten Basil, although
  he be stung with a scorpion, shall feel no pain thereby, which is a very
  different effect, and rather antidotally destroying than seminally
  promoting its production."&mdash;Sir Thomas Browne, <i>Vulgar
  Errors.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>An old writer gives the following anecdote in point:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Francis Marcio, an eminent statesman of Genoa, having sent an
  ambassador from that republic to the Duke of Milan, when he could neither
  procure an audience of leave from that prince, nor yet prevail with him
  to ratify his promises made to the Genoese, taking a fit opportunity,
  presented a handful of the herb Basil to the duke. The duke, somewhat
  surprised, asked what that meant? 'Sir,' replied the ambassador, 'this
  herb is of that nature, that if you handle it gently without squeezing,
  it will emit a pleasant and grateful scent; but if you squeeze and gripe
  it, 'twill not only lose its colour, but it <i>will become productive of
  scorpions</i> in a little time."&mdash;<i>The Entertainer</i>: London,
  1717, p. 23.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Pliny tells us that a decoction from the leaves of the ash tree, given
  as a drink, is such a remedy that "nothing so soveraigne can be found
  against the poison of serpents;" and farther:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That a <i>serpent dare not come neare the shaddow of that tree</i>.
  The serpent will chuse rather to goe into the fire than to flie from it
  to the leaves of the ash. A wonderful goodnesse of Dame Nature, that the
  ash doth bloome and flourish alwaies before that serpents come abroad,
  and never sheddeth leaves, but continueth green untill they be retired
  into their holes, and hidden within the ground."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The ancient opinion respecting the rooted antipathy between the ash
  and the serpent is not to be explained merely by the fact in natural
  history of its being an antidote, but it has a deeply mythical meaning.
  See, in the <i>Prose Edda</i>, the account of the ash Yggdrasill, and the
  serpents gnawing its roots. Loskiel corroborates Pliny as to the ash
  being an antidote:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A decoction of the buds or bark of the white ash (<i>Fraxinus
  carolina</i>) taken inwardly is said to be a certain remedy against the
  effects of poison," <i>i.e.</i> of the rattlesnake.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Serpents afford Pliny a theme for inexhaustible wonders. The strangest
  of his relations perhaps is where he tells us that serpents, "when they
  have stung or bitten a man, die for very greefe and sorrow that they have
  done such a mischeefe." He makes a special exception, however, of the
  murderous salamander, who has no such "pricke and remorse of conscience,"
  but would "destroy whole nations at one time," if not prevented. In this
  same book (xxix.) he gives a receipt for making the famous
  <i>theriacum</i>, or treacle, of vipers' flesh. Another strange notion of
  the ancients was "that the marrow of a man's backe bone will breed to a
  snake" (<i>Hist. Nat.</i>, x. 66.). This perhaps, originally, had a
  mystic meaning; for a great proportion of the innumerable serpent stories
  have a deeper foundation than a credulous fancy or lively
  imagination.</p>

  <p>Take, for instance, the wide-spread legend of the sea-serpent. Mr.
  Deane says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The superstition of 'the serpent in the sea' was known to the
  Chinese, as we observed in the chapter on the 'Serpent-worship of China.'
  But it was doubtless, at one time, a very general superstition among the
  heathens, for we find it mentioned by Isaiah, ch. xxvii. 1., 'In that day
  the Lord, with his sore and great and strong sword, shall punish
  Leviathan the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that crooked serpent: and
  He shall slay <i>the dragon that is in the sea</i>.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, vol. ii. p. 645., vol. iv. pp. 33.
  205., may be found some interesting papers on the "Scrakin, or Great Sea
  Serpent."</p>

  <p>Mr. Deane's <i>Worship of the Serpent</i> (London, 1830); and <i>The
  Cross and the Serpent</i>, by the Rev. Wm. Haslam (London, 1849), are
  noble works both of them, and ought to be in the hands of every Christian
  scholar. In these two words, "Cross" and "Serpent," we have an epitome of
  the history of the world and the human race, as well as the ground-work
  for all our hopes and fears. In them are bound up the highest mysteries,
  the truest symbolism, the deepest realities, and our nearest and dearest
  interests.</p>

  <p>Lord Bacon thus narrates the classical fable which accounts for the
  serpent's being gifted with the power of restoring youth:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The gods, in a merry mood, granted unto men not only the use of fire,
  but <i>perpetual youth</i> also, a boon most acceptable and desirable.
  They being as it were overjoyed, did foolishly lay this gift of the gods
  upon the back of an ass, who, being wonderfully oppressed with thirst and
  near a fountain, was told by a serpent (which had the custody thereof)
  that he should not drink unless he would promise to give him the burthen
  that was on his back. The silly ass accepted the condition, and <i>so the
  restoration of youth</i> (<i>sold for a draught of water</i>) <i>passed
  from men to serpents.</i>"&mdash;<i>The Wisdom of the Ancients</i>
  (Prometheus, xxvi.).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That this, as well as the whole of the legend relating to Prometheus,
  is a confused account of an early tradition relative to the Fall of Man,
  and his forfeiture of immortality, is obvious to any <!-- Page 41
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>{41}</span>unprejudiced
  mind. Lord Bacon's explanation shows that he has been overreached by his
  fancy and ingenuity.</p>

  <p>In all the ancient mysteries, the serpent was more or less
  conspicuously introduced, and always as a symbol of the invigorating or
  active power of nature. The serpent was an emblem of the sun.
  <i>Solar</i>, <i>Phallic</i>, and <i>Serpent</i> worship, are all forms
  of a single worship.<a name="footnotetag8"
  href="#footnote8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The Hindu <i>Boodh</i>, Chinese
  <i>Fo</i>, Egyptian <i>Osiris</i>, Northern <i>Woden</i>, Mexican
  <i>Quetzalcoatl</i> (feathered serpent), are one and the same. (See the
  <i>American ArchÃ¦ological Researches</i>, No. 1.; <i>The Serpent Symbol,
  and the Worship of the Reciprocal Principles of Nature in America</i>, by
  E.&nbsp;G. Squier: New York, 1851.)</p>

  <p>In Hindostan, to this day, we have the <i>Chaudravanasas</i> and the
  <i>Snaryavanasas</i>, worshippers of the moon, the aqueous or female; and
  of the sun, the igneous or male principle. The <i>Saivas</i> conjoin the
  two. Clemens Alexandrinus has a curious remark, referring to the calling
  on <i>Evoe</i> or <i>Eva</i> in the orgies of Bacchus; he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The symbol in the orgies of Bacchus is a consecrated <i>serpent</i>;
  and, indeed, if we pay attention to the strict sense of the Hebrew, the
  name <i>Evia</i>, aspirated, signifies <i>female serpent</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In my list of saints who are represented with a dragon or serpent
  beneath their feet, I omitted St. Hilary:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He is usually represented with three books. In Callot's <i>Images</i>
  he is treading on serpents, and accompanied by the text Numb. xxi. 7.
  Both these emblems allude to his opposition to Arianism; the books
  signifying the treatises he wrote against it, and the serpents the false
  doctrines and heresies which he overthrew." <i>Calendar of the Anglican
  Church Illustrated</i>: London, 1851, p. 37.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Didron's splendid work (the <i>Iconographie</i>) we have several
  references to ancient representations of our blessed Lord treading the
  dragon under foot; and sometimes the lion, the asp, and the basilisk are
  added. (See Ps. xci. 13.)</p>

  <p><i>The Conception</i> is usually represented in Christian art by a
  figure of Mary setting her foot, as second Eve, on the head of the
  prostrate serpent (in allusion to Gen. iii. 15.), and thus we find it in
  Callot's <i>Images</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Not seldom, in a series of subjects from the Old Testament, the
  pendant to Eve holding the apple is Mary crushing the head of the fiend:
  and thus the bane and antidote are both before us." (See Mrs. Jameson's
  <i>Legends of the Madonna.</i>)</p>

  <p><i>Queries on Dr. Diamond's Collodion Process.</i>&mdash;Will you
  oblige me by informing <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> through your
  valuable publication, that I am, in common with many others, extremely
  indebted to him for his collodion, and would esteem it a favour if he
  would answer the following Queries, viz.:</p>

  <p>1st. He says, in answer to a previous Query, that "nitrate of potassa"
  is <i>not</i> formed in his process. Now I wish to ask if (as the iodide
  of silver is redissolved in iodide of potassium) it is <i>not</i> formed
  when the plate is plunged into the nitrate silver bath, as the nitrate
  decomposes the iodide of potassium?</p>

  <p>2nd. How long will the collodion, according to his formulÃ¦, keep, as
  collodion made with iodide of silver generally decomposes quickly.</p>

  <p>3rdly. Why does he prohibit <i>washed</i> ether?</p>

  <p>4thly. Does he think cyanide of potassium would do as well as the
  iodide, to redissolve the iodide of silver, iodide of potassium being at
  present so dear?</p>

<p><!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span></p>

  <p>5thly. In his paper process, does not the soaking in water after
  iodizing merely take away a portion of iodides of silver and potassium
  from the paper; or, if not, what end is answered by it?</p>

  <p class="author">W. F. E.</p>

  <p><i>Baths for the Collodion Process.</i>&mdash;Having lately been
  assured, by a gentleman of scientific attainments, that the sensitiveness
  of the prepared collodion plate depends rather upon the strength of the
  nitrate of silver bath than on the collodion, I am desirous of asking how
  far the experience of your correspondents confirms this statement. My
  informant assured me, that if, instead of using a solution of thirty
  grains of nitrate of silver to the ounce of water for the bath, which is
  the proportion recommended by Messrs. Archer, Horne, Delamotte, Diamond,
  &amp;c., a sixty grain solution be substituted, the formation of the
  image would be the work of the fraction of a second. This seems to me so
  important as to deserve being brought under the notice of
  photographers&mdash;especially at this busy season&mdash;without a
  moment's delay; and I therefore record the statement at once, as, from
  circumstances with which I need not encumber your pages, I shall not have
  an opportunity of trying any experiment upon the point for a week or
  two.</p>

  <p>Upon referring to the authorities on the subject of the best solution
  for baths, I have been struck with their uniformity. One exception only
  has presented itself, which is in a valuable paper by Mr. Thomas in the
  6th Number of the <i>Journal of the Photographic Society</i>. That
  gentleman directs the bath to be prepared in the following manner:</p>

  <p>Into a 20 oz. stoppered bottle, put&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Nitrate of silver      1 oz.</p>
      <p>Distilled water       10 oz.</p>
      <p class="i2">Dissolve.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Iodide of potassium    5 grs.</p>
      <p>Distilled water        1 dr.</p>
      <p class="i2">Dissolve.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>On mixing these two solutions, a precipitate of iodide of silver is
  formed. Place the bottle containing this mixture in a saucepan of hot
  water, keep it on the hob for about twelve hours, shake it occasionally,
  now and then removing the stopper. The bath is now perfectly saturated
  with iodide of silver; when cold, filter through white filtering paper,
  and add&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Alcohol                2 drs.</p>
      <p>Sulphuric ether        1 dr.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The prepared glass is to remain in the bath about eight or ten
  minutes. Now, is this bath applicable to all collodion, or only to that
  prepared by Mr. Thomas; and if the former, what is the rationale of its
  beneficial action?</p>

  <p><i>Chronograms</i> (Vol. v., p. 585.) and <i>Anagrams</i> (Vol. iv.,
  p. 226).&mdash;Though we have ceased to practise these "literary
  follies," they are not without interest; and you will perhaps think it
  worth while to add the following to your list:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Hugo Grotius, his <i>Sophompaneas</i>.</p>
      <p class="i1">By FranCIs GoLDsMIth."</p>

  </div>

  <p>has no date on the title-page, the real date of 1652 being supplied by
  the chronogram, which is a better one than most of those quoted in "N.
  &amp; Q.," inasmuch as all the numerical letters are employed, and it is
  consequently not dependent on the typography.</p>

  <p>James Howell concludes his <i>Parly of Beasts</i> as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Gloria lausque Deo sÃ¦CLorVM in sÃ¦cVla sunto.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A chronogrammaticall verse which includes not onely this year, 1660,
  but hath numericall letters enow [an illustration, by the way, of
  <i>enow</i> as expressive of number] to reach above a thousand years
  farther, untill the year 2867."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Query, How is this made out? And are there any other letters employed
  as numerical than the M, D, C, L, V, and I? If not, I can only make
  Howell's chronogram equivalent to 1927.</p>

  <p>The author, in his <i>German Diet</i>, after narrating the death of
  Charles, son of Philip II. of Spain, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If you desire to know the yeer, this chronogram will tell you:</p>

  <p><i>Abigail</i> (Vol. iv., p. 424.; Vol. v., pp. 38. 94.
  450.).&mdash;Can it be shown that this word was in general use, as
  meaning a "lady's maid," before the time of Queen Anne. It probably was
  so used; <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>{43}</span>but I have always thought it likely that it
  became much more extensively employed, after Abigail Hill, Lady Masham,
  became the favourite of that queen. She was, I believe, a poor cousin of
  Sarah Jennings, Duchess of Marlborough, and early in life was employed by
  her in the humble capacity of lady's maid. After she had supplanted the
  haughty duchess, it is not unlikely that the Whigs would take a malicious
  pleasure in keeping alive the recollection of the early fortunes of the
  Tory favourite, and that they would be unwilling to lose the opportunity
  of speaking of a lady's maid as anything else but an "Abigail." Swift,
  however, in his use of the word, could have no such design, as he was on
  the best of terms with the Mashams, of whose party he was the very life
  and soul.</p>

  <p><i>Burial in unconsecrated Ground</i> (Vol. vi., p.

  Busbridge, in Surrey, died at Bath in March, 1756, and was, at her own
  desire, buried with two of her children in a cave in the grounds at
  Busbridge; it being excavated by a company of soldiers then quartered at
  Guildford. Their remains were afterwards disinterred and buried in

  <p><i>"Cob" and "Conners"</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 234. 321.).&mdash;These
  names are not synonymous, nor are they Irish words. It is the pier at
  Lyme Regis, and not the harbour, which bears the name of the <i>Cob</i>.
  In the "Y Gododin" of Aneurin, a British poem supposed to have been
  written in the sixth century, the now obsolete word <i>chynnwr</i> occurs
  in the seventy-sixth stanza. In a recent translation of this poem, by the
  Rev. John Williams Ab Ithel, M.A., this word is rendered, apparently for
  the sake of the metre, "shore of the sea." The explanation given in a
  foot-note is, "Harbour <i>cynwr</i> from <i>cyn dwfr</i>." On the shore
  of the estuary of the Dee, between Chester and Flint, on the Welsh side
  of the river, there is a place called "Connah's Quay." It is probable
  that the ancient orthography of the name was <i>Conner</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Cob</i>, I think, is also a British word,&mdash;<i>cop</i>, a
  mound. All the ancient earth-works which bear this name, of which I have
  knowledge, are of a circular form, except a lone embankment called <i>The
  Cop</i>, which has been raised on the race-course at Chester, to protect
  it from the land-floods and spring-tides of the river Dee.</p>

  <p><i>Coleridge's Unpublished MSS.</i> (Vol. iv., p. 411.; Vol. vi., p.
  533.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Theophylact</span>, at the first reference,
  inquired whether we are "ever likely to receive from any member of
  Coleridge's family, or from his friend Mr. J.&nbsp;H. Green, the fragments, if
  not the entire work, of his <i>Logosophia</i>." Agreeing with your
  correspondent, that "we can ill afford to lose a work the conception of
  which engrossed much of his thoughts," I repeated the Query in another
  form, at the second reference (<i>supra</i>), grounding it upon an
  assurance of Sara Coleridge, in her introduction to the <i>Biographia
  Literaria</i>, that the fragment on Ideas would hereafter appear, as a
  sequel to the <i>Aids to Reflection</i>. Whether this fragment be
  identical with the <i>Logosophia</i>, or, as I suspect, a distinct essay,
  certain it is that nothing of the kind has ever been published.</p>

  <p>From an interesting conversation I had with Dr. Green in a railway
  carriage, on our return from the Commemoration at Oxford, I learned that
  he has in his possession, (1.) A complete section of a work on <i>The
  Philosophy of Nature</i> which he took down from the mouth of Coleridge,
  filling a large volume; (2.) A complete treatise on <i>Logic</i>; and
  (3.) If I did not mistake, a fragment on <i>Ideas</i>. The reason Dr.
  Green assigns for their not having been published, is, that they contain
  nothing but what has already seen the light in the <i>Aids to
  Reflection</i>, <i>The Theory of Life</i>, and the <i>Treatise on
  Method</i>. This appears to me a very inadequate reason for withholding
  them from the press. That the works would pay, there can be no doubt.
  Besides the editing of these MSS., who is so well qualified as Dr. Green
  to give us a good biography of Coleridge?</p>

  <p><i>Selling a Wife</i> (Vol. vii., p. 602.).&mdash;A case of selling a
  wife actually and <i>bonÃ¢ fide</i> happened in the provincial town in
  which I reside, about eighteen years ago. A man publicly sold his wife at
  the market cross for 15<i>l.</i>: the buyer carried her away with him
  some seven miles off, and she lived with him till his death. The seller
  and the buyer are both now dead, but the woman is alive, and is married
  to a <i>third</i> (or a <i>second</i>) husband. The legality of the
  transaction has, I believe, some chance of being tried, as she now claims
  some property belonging to her first husband (the seller), her right to
  which is questioned in consequence of her supposed alienation by sale;
  and I am informed that a lawyer has been applied to in the case. Of
  course there can be little doubt as to the result.</p>

  <p><i>Life</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 429. 608.).&mdash;Compare with the lines
  quoted by your correspondents those of Moore, entitled "My Birthday," the
  four following especially:</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Vain was the man, and false as vain,</p>
      <p class="i1">Who said<a name="footnotetag9" href="#footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, 'Were he ordain'd to run</p>
      <p>His long career of life again,</p>
      <p class="i1">He would do all that he had done.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Many a man would gladly live his life over again, were he allowed to
  bring to bear on his <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span>second life the <i>experience</i> he had
  acquired in that past. For in the grave there is no room, either for
  <i>ambition</i> or <i>repentance</i>; and the degree of our happiness or
  misery for eternity is proportioned to the state of preparation or
  unpreparation in which we leave <i>this world</i>. Instead of many a man,
  I might have said most good men; and of the others, all who have not
  passed the rubicon of hope and grace. The vista of the past, however,
  appears a long and dreary retrospect, and <i>any</i> future is hailed as
  a relief: yet on second and deeper thought, we would mount again the
  rugged hill of life, and try for a brighter prospect, a higher
  eminence.</p>

  <i>Forrell</i>.&mdash;<i>Pillom</i> is the full word, of which
  <i>pilm</i> is a contraction. It appears to have been derived from the
  British word <i>pylor</i>, dust. <i>Forell</i> is an archaic name for the
  cover of a book. The Welsh appear to have adopted it from the English, as
  their name for a bookbinder is <i>fforelwr</i>, literally, one who covers
  books. I may mention another Devonianism. The cover of a book is called
  its <i>healing</i>. A man who lays slates on the roof of a house is, in

  <p>In explaining <i>speare</i> (so strangely misunderstood by the editor

  Richardson from the <i>Romance of the Rose</i>, and <i>Troilus and

  <p><i>Paint taken off of old Oak</i> (Vol. vii., p. 620.).&mdash;About
  twenty-six years ago, by the adoption of a very simple process
  recommended by Dr. Wollaston, the paint was entirely removed from the
  screen of carved oak which fills the north end of the great hall at
  Audley End, and the wood reassumed its original colour and brilliancy.
  The result was brought about by the application of soft-soap, laid on of
  the thickness of a shilling over the whole surface of the oak, and
  allowed to remain there two or three days; at the end of which it was
  washed off with plenty of cold water. I am aware that potash has been
  often tried with success for the same purpose; but, in many instances,
  unless it is used with due caution, the wood becomes of a darker hue, and
  has the appearance of having been charred. It is worthy of remark, that
  Dr. Wollaston made the suggestion with great diffidence, not having, as
  he said, had any practical experience of the effect of such an
  application.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The Committee appointed by the Society of Antiquaries to consider what
  improvements could be introduced into its management, has at length
  issued a Report; and we are glad to find that the alterations suggested
  by them have been frankly adopted by the Council. The principal changes
  proposed refer to the election of the Council; the having but one
  Secretary, who is not to be a member of that body; the appointment of
  Local Secretaries; the retirement annually of the Senior Vice-President;
  and lastly, that which more than anything else must operate for the
  future benefit of the Society, the appointment of a third Standing
  Committee, to be called <i>The Executive Committee</i>, whose duty shall
  be "to superintend the correspondence of the Society on all subjects
  relating to literature and antiquities, to direct any antiquarian
  operations or excavations carried on by the Society, to examine all
  papers sent for reading, all objects sent for exhibition, and to assist
  the Director generally in taking care that the publications of the
  Society are consistent with its position and importance." It is easy to
  see that if a proper selection be made of the Fellows to serve on this
  Committee, their activity, and the renewed interest which will be thereby
  awakened in the proceedings of the Society, will ensure for the Thursday
  Evening Meetings a regular supply of objects for exhibition, and papers
  for reading, worthy of the body&mdash;and therefore unlike many which we

  <p>We have now little doubt that better days are in store for the Society
  of Antiquaries.</p>

  <p>The Annual Meeting of the ArchÃ¦ological Institute commences at
  Chichester on Tuesday next, under the patronage of the Dukes of Norfolk
  and Richmond, and the Bishop of Chichester, and the Presidentship of Lord
  Talbot de Malahide. There is a good bill of fare provided in the shape of
  Lectures on the Cathedral, by Professor Willis; excursions to Boxgrove
  Priory, Halnaker, Godwood, Cowdray, Petworth, Pevensey, Amberley,
  Shoreham, Lewes, and Arundel; excavations on Bow Hill; Meetings of the
  Sections of History, Antiquities, and Architecture; and, what we think
  will be one of the pleasantest features of the programme, the Annual
  Meeting of the Sussex ArchÃ¦ological Society, in the proceedings of which
  the Members of the Institute are invited to participate.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>A Glossary of
  Provincialisms in Use in the County of Sussex</i>, by W. Durrant Cooper,
  <i>second edition</i>: a small but very valuable addition to our
  provincial glossaries, with an introduction well worth the reading. We
  shall be surprised if the meeting of the Institute this year in Sussex
  does not furnish Mr. Cooper with materials for a third and enlarged
  edition.&mdash;<i>The Traveller's Library</i>, No. 44., <i>A Tour on the
  Continent by Rail and Road</i>, by John Barrow: a brief itinerary of
  dates and distances, showing what may be done in a two months' visit to
  the Continent.&mdash;No. 45. <i>Swiss Men and Swiss Mountains</i>, by
  Robert Ferguson: a very graphic and well-written narrative of a tour in
  Switzerland, which deserves a corner in the knapsack of the "intending"
  traveller.&mdash;<i>The Essays, or Counsels Civil and Moral, by Francis
  Bacon, Viscount St. Alban</i>, edited by Thomas Markby: a cheap edition
  of this valuable "handbook for thinking men," produced by the ready sale
  which has attended <i>The Advancement of Learning</i> by the same
  editor.&mdash;<i>Reynard the Fox, after the German Version of GÃ¶the</i>,
  with Illustrations by J. Wolf, Part VII., in which the translator carries
  on the story to <i>The Outlawry</i> in well-tuned
  verse.&mdash;<i>CyclopÃ¦dia Bibliographica</i>, Part X. This tenth Part
  concludes the first half of the volume of authors and their works; and
  the punctuality with which the Parts have succeeded each other is a
  sufficient pledge that we shall see this most useful library companion
  completed in a satisfactory manner.</p>

<h2>Notices to Correspondents.</h2>

  <p>J. M. G., <i>who writes respecting the Leigh Peerage, is informed that
  we have a private letter for him. How can it be addressed to him?</i></p>

  <p>W. W. (Malta) <i>has our best thanks for his letter of the 25th of
  June. His suggestion will be adopted; but we shall shortly have the
  pleasure of addressing a</i> private <i>communication to him.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Shakspeare Criticism.</span> <i>We have to apologise
  to many friends and Correspondents for the postponement of their
  communications. As Soon as the Index to</i> Vol. vii. <i>is published, we
  shall take steps to get out of these arrears.</i></p>

  <p>C. P. F. <i>The</i> Ch <i>in the name of </i>Ch<i>obham is soft. There
  is a </i>C<i>obham within a few miles of the Camp.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Iodide</span> (June 24th). <i>There is much care
  required in iodizing paper; we have no hesitation in saying at present
  the subject has not met with sufficient attention. When the iodized paper
  is immersed in water, it is some time before it assumes a yellow colour.
  This may be accelerated by often changing the water. The brightness of
  the colour is by no means an index of its degree of
  sensitiveness&mdash;on the contrary, paper of a bright yellow colour is
  more apt to brown than one of a pale primrose. Too bright a yellow would
  also indicate an insufficient soaking; and suffering the paper to remain
  longer than is needful not only lessens its sensitive powers, but does
  much damage by removing all the size.</i></p>

  <p>H. N. (Kingston). <i>Violet-coloured glass, ground on one side, may be
  obtained at 11d. per square foot of Messrs. Forest and Brownley, Lime
  Street, Liverpool. It may also be had in London, but the price charged is
  much higher. This glass obstructs just a sufficient degree of light, and
  is most agreeable to the sitter; not much advantage accrues from the use
  of large sheets, and it is objectionable for price. No doubt such an
  application as you mention would be useful; but, from the difficulty
  there is in keeping out the wet from a glass roof, it would be very
  objectionable. Beyond a reference to our advertising columns, we cannot
  enter upon the subject of the prices of chemicals and their purity. In
  making gun cotton, the time of immersion in the acids must be the same
  for twenty grains as for any large quantity: when good, there is a
  peculiar crispness in the cotton, and it is</i> quite <i>soluble in the
  ether. If our Correspondent (who expresses so much earnestness of
  success) will forward his address, he shall receive a small portion made
  according to</i> <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond's</span> <i>formulary,
  which we find extremely soluble; and he can compare it with that of his
  own production.</i></p>

  <p>F. M. (Malta). <i>1st. We are informed by</i> <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond</span> <i>that however beautiful the results obtained by others
  in the use of Canson's paper, in his hands he has found no certainty in
  its action, and, for iodized paper for negatives, far inferior to the
  best English papers. If the salts of gold are to be used, deep tints are
  very readily obtained by the French papers. The propriety of using gold
  is very questionable, not only as affecting the after permanence of the
  picture, but from the strong contrasts generally produced being very
  offensive to an artist's eye. 2ndly. Xyloidine may be iodized precisely
  the same as collodion, but no advantage whatever is gained from its use.
  A collodion for the taking of positives on glass should be differently
  made to one for negative pictures. There should be less of the iodides
  contained in it, and it should be more fluid. When this is the case, the
  image is never washed out by the hypo., and the delineation is equal in
  minuteness to any Daguerreotype on metal plates, as has been shown by the
  specimens of the reduction of printing exhibited by Mr. Rosling at the
  Society of Arts' Exhibition, where the letters were reduced to 1-750th of
  an inch, or less than half the diameter of a human hair. If the
  protonitrate of iron</i> properly prepared <i>be used in the development,
  the deposit assumes the beautiful appearance of dead white silver, having
  none of the reflecting qualities of the metal plates.</i></p>

  <p>C. E. F. (June 13th). <i>The spots in the specimen sent depend upon
  minute substances in your collodion not receiving the action of the
  nitrate of silver bath; and you will find this upon looking through a
  prepared plate after it has been in the nitrate bath, and previously to
  its ever having been in the camera. They may be iodide or iodate of
  silver, or small crystals of nitrate of potash. If the former, add a
  little piece of iodide of potassium, say ten grains to two ounces of
  collodion; or if the latter, it would depend upon a defective washing of
  the gun cotton by which all the soluble salts have not been removed: thus
  more care must be used. We would recommend you to use an entirely new
  bath and stronger, four ounces of hypo. to a pint: it is evident that
  your very nice specimens have been spoiled by the stains of the bath.
  Allow us again to draw your attention to the process given by</i> <span
  class="sc">Mr. Pollock</span>; <i>we have seen most satisfactory pictures
  produced by it.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">R. H. Chattock</span> (Solihull). <i>The "freckled"
  appearance which you mention in your positives in all probability depends
  upon the action of the light upon the silver, which still remains in your
  proof. We have often found it to be the case when old hyposulphite of
  soda is used, and when the strength of the bath is becoming weak and
  doubtful. It is certainly a safe process to soak the picture in clean
  water for an hour or two,</i> the light being excluded <i>previous to the
  immersion into the hypo.; and the water extracting a large portion of the
  solutions remaining on the paper, the after application of the hypo. need
  not be so long continued, whereby the tone of the picture is not so much
  lowered. Your own observation, that a piece of Whatman's paper being
  merely divided, and one point exhibiting the defects and the other not,
  at once negatives the idea that the size in the paper has been
  affected.</i></p>

  <p>* <span class="sc">Example.</span>&mdash;At the commencement of the
  year 1841, a person aged thirty took out a Policy for 1000<i>l.</i>, the
  annual payment for which is 24<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in 1847 he
  had paid in premiums 168<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but the profits
  being 2Â¼ per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> per annum for each 1000<i>l.</i>) he had 157<i>l.</i>
